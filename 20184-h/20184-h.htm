<h1>UNCLE JEREMIAH AND<br />
FAMILY</h1>

<h3>AT THE GREAT FAIR</h3>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h2><i>CHAPTER I</i></h2>

<h4>ON THE WAY</h4>

<p>"Apples, pears, bananas, sweet oranges, five cents apiece."</p>

<p>"Last call for dinner in the dining car."</p>

<p>"Ah! this is comfortable," soliloquised Uncle Jeremiah. "All
the nations of the earth contribute to our appetites, and millions
are spent to transport us comfortably. Going to the World's Fair
with Mary's two children, me and Sarah. Say, stranger, what
time do you think we'll arrive?"</p>

<p>"In about two hours if we are on time, but so many people are
crowding on, that I doubt if we can get there before six o'clock."</p>

<p>Uncle Jeremiah had addressed his question to a good-natured
appearing young man just behind him who had been ostensibly
reading a newspaper but really covertly watching with admiring
glances Uncle Jeremiah's grand-daughter Fanny as she replaced
the fragments of a lunch back into the basket. Uncle was in a
communicative mood for he had just disposed of his share of
one of Aunt Sarah's admirable lunches and squared himself
round, as he called it, to talk with some one. Johnny was busy

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page8" id="page8">[Pg 8]</a></span>

investigating a hole in the seat cushion and Aunt Sarah had laid
her head against the window frame and was calmly viewing the
flying scenery outside. The two seats turned together were occupied
by Uncle Jeremiah and his family and a number of bundles
and valises.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is a great country; and, as I have lived in it nigh
onto sixty year and fit for it without seeing much of it but what
I tramped over with Sherman to the sea, I concluded to take the
whole world in at once by spending a month or so at the Exposition.
I told Sarah we'd take Mary's two children along, for I
didn't like to leave them so long with our hired help. Then
they'd be company for us. Mary was our girl, but she's dead
now, and so Johnny and Fanny must take her place. Me and
Sarah has worked hard for many a year, and we're going to
enjoy this trip ef it takes more 'n a dozen of my best Jerseys to
foot the bill. We've got the best farm and Jersey herd in Park
County, and I've made up my mind that we can afford it."</p>

<p>The stranger laid down his paper and seemed much interested
in the talking farmer and his family. Fanny had stowed the
lunch basket away under the seat and wearily laid her head
against the back of the seat, unconscious of the respectful admiration
bestowed upon her from the gentleman in conversation with
her grandfather. Fanny was a very pretty miss, just reaching
womanhood, and unsullied in thought or conduct by the usual
desire for masculine attention. Her face was warm and full,
and her light wavy hair reached her shoulders and turned up at
the ends around her neck.</p>

<p>Johnny was too industrious in his varied investigations to notice
much that was occurring about him. His keen eyes just a little
turned inward gave him the appearance of shrewdness that well
befitted him. He always investigated what he did not understand
and the World's Fair opened a field directly in his line.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page9" id="page9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>"As I was saying. I've brought along enough money to get
everything we want and to enjoy life for once. I guess we can go
back home then contented and have enough to talk about for the
rest of our natural lives."</p>

<p>Uncle's new-found friend was evidently a well-to-do commercial
traveler and there was something about him that won Uncle's
heart at once. It was not long till Uncle had relieved his mind
of all that bore on it about himself or his neighbors or his church.
Uncle was a deacon and he had many original ideas about the
social and religious economics of the world. The only pride he
had was in his Jerseys and in Fanny, and his only ambition was
to be considered a kind of Socrates by his neighbors.</p>

<p>The commercial traveler did not have much of a chance to
talk, if he had been so inclined, but he listened with very
respectful attention to the odd observations of Uncle Jeremiah.
Uncle had not talked loud, but across the aisle were two young
men who seemed to be listening more intently than befitted their
opportunity to hear. They were faultlessly attired, and frequently
exchanged observations with each other in low tones, covertly
watching Uncle and his family as if they had become very
interesting personages. Presently one moved to a seat a little
nearer, and both apparently became absorbed in their own affairs.</p>

<p>"But maybe I should beg pardon, Mister. I've been talking to
you all this time without introducing myself. I know it isn't just
the thing, but I'm not used to sassiety. I'm Jeremiah Jones,
and what is your name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Hezekiah Moses," said the traveling man,
solemnly.</p>

<p>"Ah," remarked Uncle, warmly, "that sounds a right smart
like a Jew name, but you don't look like a Jew. I Judge your
parents were very good people."</p>

<p>"They were very pious people, and, of course, brought me up in

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page10" id="page10">[Pg 10]</a></span>

the way I should go. You have quite a charming family."</p>

<p>"There now, I knew you had good judgments and I am glad
for you to say so. Of course me and Sarah are too old to be
charming and Johnny is too bad, but I take no exceptions to
Fanny."</p>

<p>Mr. Moses thoroughly agreed with Uncle on the latter observation.</p>

<p>"Johnny is all right but only last week he was training one of
my Jersey calves to walk a plank like he saw the lions In the
circus and it fell off and broke its neck and that was not a month
after it had took the prize at our county fair. And, after I had
took him atween my knees and talked to him about his responsibility
to his Creator, he didn't wait two days till he cut off the
colt's tail so as to make it bobbed like the British and it kicked
and broke its leg on the cross bar. But I do believe he's got the
making of a man in him after all. I think he must be like his
father, though I never seed him. You see Mary she run off to
marry some man she fell in with when she went off to school, and
I forbid her letting him come to see her, for you see he might be
some city fortune hunter; but Mary said she knowed, and so one
day when we went to town somebody drove up to our house in a
buggy and I never seed her any more. I didn't think she ought
to take that way to somebody I didn't know. I must have been
hard hearted them days, but somehow I couldn't help it. Sarah
she went to see them lots of times over in the big town across in
Ohio but I couldn't leave Indiana and when Johnny was born
Mary she died a senden good words to me but I couldn't help it."</p>

<p>The old man drew his sleeve across his eyes and continued,
"You see Mary's man was all broke down, and he told Sarah to
take the children and he'd go wandering around the world for a
year or two. Mary was the only child we had living, and when
she died I wanted to move away from where she used to play

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page11" id="page11">[Pg 11]</a></span>

when she was a little girl, so in two years I got a good offer, and
I sold out. All four of us went to see my sister in the city, and
somehow didn't tell nobody where we were going, but I said I
thought we would go on to California. Well, I found a stock farm
in Illinois, and after a while we went back to our old home
visiting, and the old neighbors told us a nice looking man had
come soon after we left, and was nearly distracted to find us gone.
He advertised and spent lots of money trying to find us, but at
last went away broken-hearted. Then I sent Sarah right to Ohio,
but Mary's man had sold his big clothing store, and some said he
had gone to California, and others said one place and another, but
he couldn't be found. He never came back to our old home
place, nor to his old home place, for I've kept a writing ever
since. Somehow he had to give us up. It broke me all down,
and I've been doing all I could for the children. Fanny is
getting a good education, for our town has got to be a big one
now, and has a fine college in it; but I can't educate Johnny.
He's always experimenting and doing damage. Howsumever,
he's a great trader, and I'm going to give him a start some
time. Why, I gave him a shote a month ago, and I don't believe
there is a sled or a jack-knife in the hull neighborhood any more,
for Johnny's got them in our garret, but the pig is gone.</p>

<p>"But say, Mr. Moses, you haven't said a word about your
business yet, and I've been a bragging about my farm and stock
for half an hour."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that, Mr. Jones. I haven't got much to
tell. I'm a traveling salesman for a Chicago house; and, like
you, I intend to rest up for a couple of weeks and see the Fair.
I am happy to say that I stand well with my firm, and I am to be
taken in as the junior member soon. The head of the firm has
been the friend to whom I owe all my advancement and advantage.
I hope sometime to settle down into a quiet business life

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page12" id="page12">[Pg 12]</a></span>

and enjoy a home once more. Your talk takes me back to my
old Indiana home and its comforts."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's it, Mr. Moses, it is plain your parents have given
your mind a good mold. Here, newsboy, just bring over to me
and Mr. Moses two of your best five cent cigars and we'll go into
the smoker and have a smoke. I don't never smoke cigars, but
these are extra days, and we can afford the luxuries."</p>

<p>The idea seemed to amuse Mr. Moses, but he complied with
the request of the friendly farmer, and, with a good-natured wink
at the newsboy, took out a cigar and deftly stuck it into his
pocket as he pulled out one of his own.</p>

<p>Uncle could find no change and without more ado took out a
roll of bills from his breast pocket. The smallest bill was ten
dollars but neither Mr. Moses nor the boy could change it. One
of the young men across the aisle volunteered to help them out of
the difficulty and counted the change into Uncle's hand. Just
then the newsboy's heel struck Mr. Moses' foot sharply and there
was a quick response. The change went into one of Uncle's
trouser's pockets and the roll of bills into the other, when he and
Mr. Moses went into the smoking car and were soon behind a
cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>The newsboy came in presently and there were a few whispered
words between him and Mr. Moses.</p>

<p>"Apples, pears, bananas, sweet oranges, here, five cents apiece."</p>

<p>There was no sale for anything eatable in the smoker just then
and the boy returned to the rear cars.</p>

<p>"You didn't notice when the gentleman across the aisle made
change for you that you got flim-flamed did you?"</p>

<p>"That I got what?" said Uncle.</p>

<p>"That you got flim-flamed. Did you count your change when
that young gent gave it to you? This is a money making
occasion you know and the gentry are on the make."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page13" id="page13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course I counted the money. Nobody gets me that way."</p>

<p>"I'll bet a cigar that you haven't got over seven dollars of that
ten dollar bill."</p>

<p>"It's a go," said Uncle as he thrust his hand into his pocket <ins class="correction" title="original: and and">and</ins>
drew out a handfull of coins. He laid his hat between his
knees and counted the money into it. "Six dollars, six fifty, six
seventy-five, seven, seven ten, seven fifteen."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/image7.jpg" width="350" height="345"
alt="image7" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"UNCLE AND MR. MOSES WERE SOON BEHIND A CLOUD OF SMOKE."</span>
</div>

<p>"Ah, I've not got it all out of my pocket," and Uncle's hand dived
hastily into his trousers but came out empty. A look of consternation
came into his face as he looked at the laughing salesman.</p>

<p>"Well, by Jove! I don't often lose my bets, but here, Uncle, is

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page14" id="page14">[Pg 14]</a></span>

the cigar, for I've lost the bet. You have fifteen cents more
than seven dollars. I didn't watch that gent's counting as well
as I thought," and Uncle mechanically took the cigar he had so
generously given to Mr. Moses a few minutes before.</p>

<p>"It's worth it, Mr. Moses, it's worth it. I don't begrudge the
fellow for his two dollars and six bits. I feel like I ought to go in
and thank him for the lesson."</p>

<p>"Cigars, gentlemen, best Havanas. Here, old man, is the
rest uv yer change. The chappie back there wanted to kick, but
he couldn't stand me look. I don't 'low no working uv me
customers dat way. You see I wur next to him in a minute."</p>

<p>"Ah, my boy, nobody can talk to me any more about dishonorable
newsboys. You keep that money. I won't have a cent of
it. I'm willin' to pay fer my teaching. And here's a dollar more
for you to go right back there and supply my folks with whatever
eating things you've got that they want.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Moses, I know before I get through with them
Arabs and Esquimaux, and Indians and African savages at Chicago
I'm going to know a good deal more than I do now, and I
never in my life got something for nothing, and it's too late for
me to begin now."</p>

<p>The first suburban station of the great World's Fair city was
now passed and Mr. Moses said he must return to his seat and
get his grip ready for leaving the train at the next station. He
gave Uncle a card on which was printed:</p>

<table summary="card" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td class="footnotes"><span style="padding-left: 5em"><i>William Warner</i></span><br /><span style="font-size: smaller"><i>With The Clarendon Company</i><br /><i>Wholesale Clothiers</i></span></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>As he did so, he said, "Now Uncle, remember never to give
a chance to pickpockets or confidence men, watch your change

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page15" id="page15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

and take directions only from those you know to be responsible
officers; and if at any time you need a friend, don't fail to call
at the office of the firm and present that card."</p>

<p>They returned to their seats and a frown came over Mr. Moses'
face when he saw the companion of the disreputable money
changer glibly talking to Aunt Sarah and Fanny. The young man
bowed himself away very gracefully and went to his seat as Uncle
and Mr. Moses came up.</p>

<p>Uncle gave Mr. Moses a hearty hand shake and God bless
you as he started for the car door; but, to the astonishment of Mr.
Moses Aunt Sarah and Fanny looked scornfully at him and did
not in any way acknowledge his parting salute.</p>

<p>"Baggage, have your baggage checked?"</p>

<p>"Well, what a town Chicago is, anyhow. Here they've sent a
man to take care of our baggage. Now, I call that all-fired
hospital. Get the checks quick, Sarah."</p>

<p>"What hotel?" Inquired the agent.</p>

<p>"We're not overly pertiklar. I was talkin' some with a young
fellow back here who said he was a hotel agent; but I don't mind
if I go where you say. How high are your rates?"</p>

<p>"The Auditorium&mdash;as high as you want to go; the Northern,
fourteen stories, and the Palmer, out of sight."</p>

<p>"Well, Mister, we don't want to go out of sight, and we don't
know how high we do want to go so I guess you'd better make it
fourteen stories."</p>

<p>The agent took the checks, gave him some tickets and
passed on.</p>

<p>In a few minutes a uniformed young man came along and
said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones, I'd like very much to book you for one of our
down-town hotels. Every convenience, gas, baths, heat, and all
the modern appliances; near car lines that land you right at the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page16" id="page16">[Pg 16]</a></span>

Exposition gates. Best place in the city. Take you right there
free of cost."</p>

<p>"But how high is it?"</p>

<p>"Only one dollar a day apiece and up as high as you want
to go."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's it, young man. I see your mother taught you
United States. You see the <ins class="correction" title="original: buggage">baggage</ins> man said fourteen stories
and I didn't understand the city way of charging."</p>

<p>"Shall I book you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"O we may stay a month. May be less."</p>

<p>"Say two weeks."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Here's your ticket with coupons. Fifty-six dollars please."</p>

<p>"But I haven't seen the place nor got the money's worth. I'm
Deacon Jones and I always pay my debts."</p>

<p>"No difference, it's the rules."</p>

<p>"Mr. Moses said not to deal only with responsible officers.
How may I be sure you are a responsible officer?"</p>

<p>"I'll prove it by the conductor."</p>

<p>The conductor was called and Uncle Jeremiah paid over his
money and received his printed directions.</p>

<p>"Where are your baggage checks?"</p>

<p>"O, I've already attended to that. I'll see to that myself."</p>

<p>The hotel agent left and the two young men across the aisle
watched with satisfaction as Uncle folded his big roll of bills and
deposited them in his left trouser's pocket.</p>

<p>"There it is&mdash;there is the White City," some one yelled, and
the people rose from their seats and looked at the most favored
spot of the earth as long as it could be seen. Houses flew by,
stations were passed; the placid lake, flecked with many boats,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page17" id="page17">[Pg 17]</a></span>

lapped the shore as with some friendly greeting. The great
buildings of Chicago's business center appeared in view, and the
end of their journey was near at hand.</p>

<p>"<ins class="correction" title="original: &quot;Chicago,&quot; all out!&quot;">Chicago, all out!"</ins></p>

<p>"Listen at 'em," said <ins class="correction" title="original: no comma after Uncle">Uncle</ins>, "they've got our money and now
they're goin' to put us off. But I guess we must be there."</p>

<span class="caption">"UNCLE WAS BEING ROUGHLY HANDLED BY THE TWO MEN."</span>
</div>

<p>All the people were standing as the magic words were yelled
in at the front door by the brakeman. Uncle Jeremiah had not
been as excited since he heard of the fall of Richmond.</p>

<p>With a valise, packed almost to bursting, in each hand, Uncle
was preparing to do whatever he saw others do. The two
young men from across the aisle had also arisen and pressed into

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page18" id="page18">[Pg 18]</a></span>

the crowd. One was directly in front of Uncle, and the one who
had made the false change had crowded himself between Uncle
and Aunt Sarah. The train slowed up as the depot was reached,
and all crowded toward the door. There was a low chirrup, and
Uncle was being roughly jostled about by the two men, when
there was a cry of "pickpockets," and the train-boy was seen
swinging on to the wrist of one of the men behind Uncle and
yelling "let 'er go; let 'er go."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 355px;">

<span class="caption">"UNCLE GAVE HIS CHECKS TO THE NEAREST CAB DRIVER"</span>
</div>

<p>The man held a wallet in his hand, but with a curse he dropped
it, tore loose from the boy and rushed through the door,
disappearing in the crowd.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page19" id="page19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here, Mister, is yer wad. Yer wants ter keep yer eye
skinned fur them fellers."</p>

<p>Uncle warmly thanked the boy but he received this second
lesson with a little less complacency than the first. Following the
crowd to the outside he presented his tickets to the first hack
driver he came to.</p>

<p>"You are pretty well supplied, aren't you dad. You have the
right of way to two hotels. Which do you want?"</p>

<p>"Take us to the one I've paid fer."</p>

<p>"Which is that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess it must be the down town hotel."</p>

<p>"They are both down hotels. I see your baggage is booked for
the Northern and I suppose you want to follow your baggage."</p>

<p>Without more ado all four were placed into the uncomfortably
crowded hack and shortly unloaded at the Northern. An obsequious
porter ushered them into the office and Uncle was
astounded with a demand for twenty dollars down. "But I've
paid," Uncle protested. The clerk looked at his card and
assured him he was at the wrong hotel. It was now dark and
Uncle concluded to pay the money and start out anew the next
day. They were shown to their rooms by way of the elevator and
more dead than alive, to use Aunt Sarah's expression, they flung
themselves into chairs and Johnny yelled, "This is Chicago, what
I've heard them talk about." They went to the windows and
could not repress a shudder as they saw the street lights so far
below. Aunt Sarah did not see how she could sleep so high up,
but when their evening meal was done and the events of the day
discussed they became as sleepy and they felt as safe as they
did with the whippoorwill singing in the orchard and the hogs
grunting lazily in the lane.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER II</i></h2>

<h4>NOW FOR THE FAIR</h4>

<p>The next morning Uncle Jeremiah was up as usual at four
o'clock, chafing like a caged stable horse that could not get out
to fresh air and the tempting pastures.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 331px;">

<span class="caption">"I THINK OF EARTHQUAKES EVERY TIME I LOOK OUT."</span>

<p>"These confounded people won't let a fellow have his meals
only at their own convenience, and the feelin' of earthquakes
keeps a growing on me every time I look down out of that

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page23" id="page23">[Pg 23]</a></span>

window. I've got to quit it." Aunt Sarah shared the same
feeling, but John and Fanny decided that it was not half as high
as they wanted to go before they left Chicago.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 632px;">
<img src="images/image11.jpg" width="632" height="375" alt="image11" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"Say, Mister, I've paid fare once on this tarnal machine."</span>
</div>

<p>In due time the city awoke, with a rush and a roar, to the
business of the day. Uncle found the office of the boarding
house syndicate a few doors away, and the family were soon
safely housed in more congenial quarters.</p>

<p>"The Fair, Father, the Fair! When will we ever get to see
the Fair? I just heard a man say that it's ten o'clock, and here
we are a-fussing about in the rooms and missin' the sights."</p>

<p>Johnny was impatient, but not long after, the family hailed a
passing street car and were on their way at last.</p>

<p>"Twenty cents is the fare for four of you."</p>

<p>The conductor rang the fares and passed on. The new scenes
of the city absorbed their attention, but Uncle soon began shifting
in his seat, and at last whispered to Aunt Sarah: "Say, I
noticed that we went clear 'round a hull lot of blocks, and it
'pears ter me that we air goin' right backards to where we ought
to go, or else this 'ere town has got two parts a blamed sight
alike."</p>

<p>"Fare, please!"</p>

<p>"Say, Mister, I've paid fare once on this tarnal machine.
How often do you have to pay&mdash;every once in a while?"</p>

<p>"Are you riding around for your health, or do you want to go
somewhere?"</p>

<p>"That's it, Mister, exactly. I wish you'd drive this riding
machine at once to the World's Fair. You've got it pasted on
the front of your engine, and yet you're takin' us right back past
where we got on."</p>

<p>"Sure, old man, you're all right, only you got on a car going
the wrong way, and so went on around the loop. But you're all
right now. I'll land you at the grounds; but twenty cents, please."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page24" id="page24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Twenty cents were forthcoming, and shortly the family found
themselves in a maze of booths, people, streets and vehicles. It
was not difficult to follow the crowd, and in a few minutes the
amazed family were walking the streets of the great White City.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 129px;">
<img src="images/image12.jpg" width="129" height="227" alt="image12" title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>"Guides, World's Fair Guides!"</p>

<p>Uncle stopped a moment as a boy planted himself in front of
him, thus calling him from the amazement
of the wonderful city down to the realities
of the earth.</p>

<p>"Guides, Mister, only twenty-five cents.
This little book contains all you want
to know about yonder lovely city&mdash;for the
price of one small quarter you have a key
to all the doors of the Fair&mdash;with this book
no Columbian guard can call you down&mdash;you
are free and independent of everybody
with this book in your hands&mdash;it's only a
quarter, remember, only twenty-five cents!
Illustrated, tells you everything."</p>

<p>"That's it Sarah, let's buy one of these books and go home. It
tells us every thing and it is illustrated. What's the use of wearing
our eyes out and our feet off when we can learn it all out of
this feller's book. I feel all done up on the first sight. It's too
big a job fer me to undertake. I didn't calculate on such a big
show."</p>

<p>"No, my boy. I wish I could accommodate ye but you see I
ain't got no time on the grounds for reading or I'd a brought the
Scriptures along. I judge it prophesied this when it spoke of signs
and wonders appearing."</p>

<p>"Only a quarter, sir."</p>

<p>Uncle shook his head, but Fanny produced a quarter and took
one of the books.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page25" id="page25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>Near by was a booth where camp stools were to be leased.</p>

<p>"That is what Sarah and I will need. These young ones can
walk all day." Directly Johnny had a folded camp chair in each
hand and they went on following the crowd toward the Administration
building. They did not go inside as most of the people
did but continued on around till the basin between the Peristyle
and the Administration building appeared in view. Through the
columns of the Peristyle at the far end of the basin they could see
the blue lake meeting the summer clouds; above them rose the
dome of the Administration building till it seemed almost to pierce
the clouds. They were looking upon a scene never before
excelled in grandeur by the art of man. The basin was filled
with gondolas gracefully plied by Venetians, launches moving both
by steam and by electricity and gay sailboats of every description.
In the far end of the basin was to be seen the Statue of
the Republic sixty-five feet tall and standing forty feet above the
water on its great stone foundation. The MacMonnies fountain was
roaring with the fall of water and the heroic figures of Columbia
enthroned in her triumphal barge guided by Time and heralded by
Fame was outlined against the Agricultural building. From the
dome of that massive structure, exhibiting the produce of our
land, Diana with her drawn bow seemed to be aiming directly at
them.</p>

<p>"Let us sit down," said Aunt, as the first wave of the wonderful
vision passed over them.</p>

<p>"I feel more like saying, let us kneel down," said Uncle.</p>

<p>Fanny read from the front of the Administration building the
inscriptions there about Columbus and his work.</p>

<p>High over the north entrance were the words:</p>

<p>"Columbus received from Ferdinand and Isabel, Sovereigns of
Spain, a commission as Admiral of an exploring fleet, April 30,
1492."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page26" id="page26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Over the east entrance she read:</p>

<p>"Columbus sailed from Palos with three small vessels, Aug. 3,
and landed on one of the Bahama Islands."</p>

<p>What common-place facts so simply stated! But they brought
forth thoughts and emotions greater and greater of the wonderful
consequences to mankind.</p>

<p>"Grandpa, you see how we have come here to learn of the
world and its progress to this greatness."</p>

<p>"Do not speak to me now, child; I want to think," and Uncle
bowed his head in his hands.</p>

<p>No one said anything for a few minutes, when Johnny startled
them by yelling "Gorgeous! gorgeous!"</p>

<p>"Of course it's gorgeous," said Fanny; "but you needn't yell
that way. You must not forget that you are not in our barnyard
now."</p>

<p>Johnny subsided. He had expressed his opinion, and he was
ready to move on.</p>

<p>Uncle arose and said: "I guess we are able to go to the next
scene now, and I warn you all that the word gorgeous is as high
as we will be allowed to go in expressing ourselves, no matter
what we see. There has got to be a limit somewhere, and I
judge that gorgeous is far enough."</p>

<p>"Is that the statyure of Mrs. Columbus?" asked Johnny.</p>

<p>"No, it's the Statue of the Republic."</p>

<p>"I declare I've been watching them things on that Statue of
the Republic, and I really believe they're men instead of being
pigeons."</p>

<p>"They are men," said Fanny. "No wonder that they look so
little, for the book here says her forefinger is four feet long.
Look at that figure on the top of the big building yonder. That
Is Diana, the huntress. How tall do you think she is?"</p>

<p>"Nine feet," said Johnny, promptly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page27" id="page27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Life-size," said Uncle.</p>

<p>"Both wrong. The book says she is eighteen feet tall."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my girl, this looks like a dream, but it ain't,
is it?"</p>

<p>There was a band-stand in front of them, and beyond that was
a massive building, which Fanny found was Machinery hall. As
they went on to it, Fanny read to them that it covered over
twenty acres of ground and cost nearly a million and a half
dollars. As they entered the door they saw one awful mass of
moving machinery.</p>

<p>Uncle said he thought they had better sit down again and
think awhile before venturing further, but Johnny urged them to
come on so they could see something and do their thinking
afterward.</p>

<p>They came to one of the doors of the power house, and Uncle
sat down.</p>

<p>"I can't stand this pressure," he said, "I tell you I've got to
sit down and look at this thing." At his left he could see into
the power house nearly five hundred feet long and full from one
end to the other of great boilers with the red fires glowing underneath.</p>

<p>On the right he looked across the hall where the great power
wheel was flying and saw five hundred feet of whirling wheels,
while before him there was an unobstructed view of machines but
little short of a thousand feet.</p>

<p>They went over to the middle aisle and on past the larger
machinery.</p>

<p>"Why Grandma, you are walking by me with your eyes shut.
What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Well you see, Fanny, it's too much to look at so many millions
of things so I just shut my eyes and think. What's the
difference if I do miss a few thousand sights."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page28" id="page28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's so, Fanny, we aint got used to looking yet. It looks
like they had everything a working here but my old shaving horse.
I wouldn't be surprised any minute to see that it had walked away
from the woodshed and come over to show itself off in this here
exposition. I believe I'll go over and offer them my old barlow
knife. It's a score of years old but <ins class="correction" title="original: it'l">it'll</ins> bore a hole for a hame
string all right <ins class="correction" title="original: closing quote missing">yet."</ins></p>

<p>They came to the place where they were making watches with
the complex, automatic machinery that defies the eye to detect
its movements, then there was the sewing machine with a man
riding it like a bicycle and sewing carpet in strips a hundred feet
long. There were knitting machines and clothing machines, and
carving and molding machines, and type-setting machines, till
the day was spent and they had seen only how much there was
to see.</p>

<p>"It takes taste to paint pictures, and art to make sculpture,
and mind to write books, and genius to carry on war, but I tell
you, my girl," said Uncle, "that it takes brains to make machinery."</p>

<p>Passing through a south door they went on around Machinery
hall. Some working men were passing by singly or in twos and
threes. One had a wrench in one hand and a queer looking bottle
in the other. The ludicrous side of the exposition now began
to appear. Nothing can become so great that amusing things
will not occur. They are the relaxations of mental life. One of
the guards saw the man and his bottle.</p>

<p>"Hi, there," he shouted. The workman came to a stop, the
bottle being ostensibly concealed behind his apron. "What
are you bringing beer into machinery hall for?"</p>

<p>"I ain't got any beer," replied the workman.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me any such stuff. You've got a bottle under your
apron."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page29" id="page29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/image13.jpg" width="338" height="548" alt="image13" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"The Guard was determined to do his duty."</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page31" id="page31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"No I haven't," and the culprit as if by accident let a portion
of the bottle drop into sight. The guard made a grab for it and
held it up before the seemingly confused workman.</p>

<p>"I'll just take you to the station-house," declared the officer.
"What did you mean by telling me you had no beer?"</p>

<p>"It ain't beer. It's&mdash;it's&mdash;ginger ale."</p>

<p>The prisoner was lying. That was evident to the guard. At
the same time he did not want to be placed in the position of
disobeying orders against making trivial arrests. He knew by the
color of the liquid it was not ginger ale. A brilliant thought came
to him. He would test the beer and thus have the evidence.
But here a difficulty was encountered. While the rule prohibiting
<ins class="correction" title="original: employes">employees</ins> from bringing intoxicants into the grounds is a strict one,
there is a much severer regulation against guards tasting the stuff
while on duty. What if his sergeant should see him with a bottle
of beer to his lips! To meet this obstacle the guard led his prisoner
to a secluded place behind a big packing case, and after
looking fearfully around hastily uncorked the bottle and sent a
huge swallow of the contents down his throat.</p>

<p>The result was unexpected so far as the blue coat was concerned.
With a howl of anguish he dropped the bottle. Both
eyes started from his head and his face turned to ashen paleness
as he danced about the floor shrieking "I am poisoned." Finally
he sank down with a moan and the men attracted by his cries
carried him to a bench and laid him down. On the edge of the
human circle about him the guard beheld the face of his prisoner.
Beckoning him to his side the guard feebly said, "What was
that stuff in the bottle?"</p>

<p>"Lard oil and <ins class="correction" title="original: naptha">naphtha</ins>"," replied the workman.</p>

<p>The guard was removed to the hospital, while the workmen
were laughing their heartiest. In an hour the stricken officer was
back at his post.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page32" id="page32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>That afternoon, as the family climbed the stairs to the station
on their way back to the hotel, Uncle Jeremiah was a study to
the student of human nature. The size of the Exposition had
dazed and awed him. He wore a neat paper collar with an old-fashioned
ready-made necktie pushed under the points. The
slouch hat was down over his ears, as a heavy wind was tearing
across the high landing. His manner was that of one oppressed
by a great sorrow. He looked at the turrets and domes and the
hundreds of dancing flags and shook his head solemnly. When
the people around him gabbled and pointed their fingers and piled
up the same old adjectives he glanced around at them timidly
and then stepped softly away where he could gaze without being
interrupted. After boarding the car he stood up between the seats
and held on to the railing. At each curve of the track, as new
visions swung into view, he shook his head again and again, but
said nothing. He had been for a good many years taking in a
daily landscape of stubble-field, orchard and straight country
roads. His experience had taught him that a red two-story hay
press was a big building. To him the huddle of huckster
stands at the county fair made a pretty lively spectacle. Then
he was rushed into Chicago. With the roar of wheels still in his
ears and the points of the compass hopelessly mixed, he found
himself being fed into the Exposition gate with a lot of strange
people. The magnitude of the great enterprise was more than
any intellect could fully grasp. His mind perceived so much
that was strange and new that he became as that one who saw
men as trees walking. His eyes were opened to a new world.
He was now a living part of the intellectual vision and prophecy
of the "Dream City."</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER III</i></h2>

<h4>AROUND THE WORLD FOR TWENTY CENTS</h4>

<p>The next day, when the "Alley L" road let them off at the
station next to the electric road, they decided to ride around and
view the "White City" from that elevated position. The intramural
road is about three miles around, and makes the trip in
seventeen minutes. It was like going around the world in that
time, so much was to be seen on either side.</p>

<p>The four made a fine picture of age and youth gathering
mental breadth from this great exhibition of human wisdom and
achievement. They passed around the west end of Machinery
hall and along the south side of it, then between the Agricultural
annex and the stock pavilion. Here they emerged into what
seemed to be the waste yard of the Exposition, debris of all
kinds, beer houses, lunch rooms, hundreds of windmills flying in
the breeze and heavily loaded cars, back of which could be seen
bonfires of waste materials, these making a striking contrast to the
white beauty and massive art on the opposite side of the car.</p>

<p>The queer looking Forestry building flew by, the leather exhibit
was passed, and the train ran around a station not far from the
Krupp gun works. They had not yet made the grand tour of
the grounds, but another investment in tickets sent them back
again, the way they had come, on the parallel track. When
they reached the west side they looked away from the massive
buildings across Stony Island avenue at the amusing medley of
hotels, booths for lunches, and tents for blue snakes, sea monsters,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page34" id="page34">[Pg 34]</a></span>

and fat women strung along the front. Little merry-go-rounds
buzzed like tops in cramped corners between pine lemonade
stands and cheap shooting-galleries. Looking eastward, the eye
rests with satisfaction upon the gilded satin of the Administration
dome, and then it may take an observation to the westward of a
flaunting placard:</p>

<table summary="placard" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td class="footnotes"><span style="padding-left: 1.5em"><i>Four Tintypes</i></span><br /><i>for Twenty-five Cents</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Back of the sandwich counters and fortune-telling booths are
stored the World's Fair hotels, looking like overgrown store
boxes, with holes punched in them.</p>

<p>The train flew on, and uncle saw little of the outside because
of his interest in the strange machinery that was propelling them
forward. The engineer pulled a lever and then there was a buzz
and a whirr; another lever was turned, and the car would come
to a standstill at some station. It was amazing to see such
simple movements by one man control such unseen energy.
From the farm to the Exposition grounds was as marvelous a
change as from one world to another, and to the simple genius of
rural work it was like going from the peaceful valley to the
mysteries beyond the clouds.</p>

<p>Past the Esquimau village, the richly varied city of state and
foreign buildings came into view. All the varieties of architectural
genius from the different countries of the world appeared one after
another and it was easy to imagine a flight of incredible speed all
over the earth. The terminal station at the northeast was
reached and uncle wanted to ride back again. In this way the
panorama of the great Fair was quite well fixed in their minds
when they descended from the southeast station at the entrance

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page35" id="page35">[Pg 35]</a></span>

of Agricultural hall. For once Uncle felt at home when he walked
into that paradise of grass and grain.</p>

<p>"Every body but me and Sarah can scatter and we'll all meet
at the far end of this house, or if not there at the south side of
the Sixty-third street gate at <ins class="correction" title="original: closing quote missing">six o'clock."</ins> Fanny and Johnny took
Uncle at his word and were soon strolling among the booths, but
they were more intent upon watching the maneuvers of the various
types of people than of observing what the earth is able to produce
out of its soil. They heard a band playing somewhere in the distance
and they moved on that way.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page36" id="page36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>As a curious observer of this moving world, Fanny made note
of the many interesting exhibitions about her of country ignorance
and enthusiasm. At one place she stopped near a tall, lank
farmer, whose cowhide boots had left their massive imprint on
every roadway on the grounds. He stood chewing a wisp of hay
plucked from an exhibit, while he gazed in delight at the harvesters,
plows and sheaves of wheat which stretched away before
him in an endless vista.</p>

<p>"Wall, I swan," he at length confided to the dignified guard,
who stood like a sign-post near the door, "this 'ere's the only
thing I've seed 'minded me of hum. Bin tramping raound these
'ere grounds, scence 7 o'clock, b'gosh, an' ain't seen a blamed
thing did my ole heart so much good as this show right here.
By George! wish I'd a struck this buildin' fust thing I come in.
Would a saved me a power of walkin'. Say, had a great show
out our way a spell ago. Had a corn palace&mdash;Sioux City, you
know. Be they goin' to have a corn palace at this 'ere fair?"</p>

<p>The guard unbent enough to guess not.</p>

<p>"Sho! y' don't say so. Wall, that's curious. Corn palace
out to hum was the biggest show ever give out that way. And
crowd! Say, I'll bet a nickel I've seed as many as hundreds
of people thar in one day. In one day, reclect, all just looking at
that there corn palace. Wonder these fellows didn't think of
that. Would a drawd all the folks from out in our section, shore.
Tell you what I don't like about this show," he went on, waxing
confidential, "Too much furrin stuff here. Don't see nothing
from Keokuk, Sioux City, Independence or even old Davenport.
But all London and Berlin and Paris, and all them other places
where they's kings and things. Ought to a give the folks here
more of a show, b'gosh, same as we did out to hum. Why, they
wasn't none of this statoo stuff thar, I tell you. Wasn't no
picters and the like of that. What good is them picters over

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page37" id="page37">[Pg 37]</a></span>

there, I'd like to know? Why, some on 'em, the folks ain't got
a stitch of clothes on 'em, and you couldn't hang them air
picters in a barn. Ought to have more of these things here&mdash;oats
and wheat and seedin' machines. Them's what people
want to see. And say, I was daown here below this mornin', and
by gum, I seed the damdest lookin' fellows I ever seen in all my
born days. They was heathen Turks, I reckon, with rags round
their heads and wimmin's clo'es on all o' 'em. I was a-scared
to stay there, b'gosh, and I jest lit out, I tell ye. Well, I'm goin'
through here and see what you've <ins class="correction" title="original: g t">got</ins>, but I jest tell you this is
the part of this show that'll do. Yes, sir." And the rural
visitor stalked away.</p>

<p>In less than two hours the brother and sister had reached the
west doorway, but uncle and aunt were nowhere to be seen.
Then they went up into the <ins class="correction" title="original: gall ry">gallery</ins> to hear the musicians again.
It was very evident that Agricultural hall had swallowed their
grandparents for that day and the grandchildren were left to shift
for themselves. It was now past noon and they were both
hungry enough to welcome the first lunch counter they could find.
One o'clock found them again wandering listlessly about the
gallery absorbed in the sights about them.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER IV</i></h2>

<h4>ESCORT AND BODY GUARD</h4>

<p>"Hist, me boys," said one of a group of young men near the
band-stand, who were watching the people moving about them,
"Me eye has caught sight of something forbidden to all the rest
of the world. You can look but you must mustn't touch. Give
me your prayers boys." He sauntered away from them and
came near to Fanny and Johnny as if intensely interested in all
that was about him. Fanny was standing near the balustrade
that was around the gallery, when the opportunity the young man
was watching for soon came. Some rude man hurrying by struck
her arm in such a way as to knock her hand-satchel out of her
hand and it fell to the main floor far below. In an instant the
young man lifted his hat, and bowing to her ran down the near
flight of stairs; taking the satchel from some one near whom it
had fallen, he hurried back and gave it to her with a profound bow.
Seeming to recognize her all at once he made another bow and
said, "Ah, pardon me but I see I have just had the honor of serving
Miss Jones, whom I met on the train a few days ago."
Hardly knowing just what to do, she thanked him and hesitated,
but he was not slow to turn the tide in his favor and was soon
chatting in such a very agreeable way about the many scenes that
she soon forgot all doubts as to propriety. It was now three
o'clock in the afternoon and she thought of her grandparents and
what they would think; but the three hours till meeting time at

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page41" id="page41">[Pg 41]</a></span>

60th street gate flew by under the interesting guidance of the
young man on whose card Fanny read</p>

<p>He explained that (S. S.) was a sign that meant "Secret Service"
as he had told her before how he had been sent out to
shadow Mr. Moses. They rested for awhile on one of the seats
in the gallery and Mr. Blair took great interest in showing Fanny
his official papers and commissions. Surely he was a very honorable
and talented man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 386px;">

<span class="caption">"He bowed to her, and then ran down the near flight of stairs."</span>
</div>

<p>While he was pointing out his name on one of these papers, a
gentleman came by who started on seeing them, as if in the most
pained surprise.</p>

<p>"That man means her some harm," he said to himself, <ins class="correction" title="original: opening quote missing">"and</ins> I
feel as if I have no manhood if I do not undertake somehow to
prevent it. But he has told her something terrible against me
and I have no way to approach her."</p>

<p>The two arose to go and the gentleman walked not far behind.</p>

<p>"You do not know how it pains me, Mr. Blair, to know that
such a noble looking young man as Mr. Moses, is a man under
police surveilance. He has such an agreeable and gentlemanly
appearance."</p>

<p>"That is true Miss Jones, but you have no idea how perfectly
these criminals can assume an appearance of culture and high
social standing."</p>

<p>Six o'clock had come swiftly and as they approached the gate
Uncle and Aunt were seen sitting on their camp stools at the
appointed place. The young man excused himself before reaching
them and bowed himself away, but not before he had learned her

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page42" id="page42">[Pg 42]</a></span>

address and that they came every day through the 60th street
gates at nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>"Where is Johnny?" anxiously inquired Aunt as Fanny came
up alone.</p>

<p>For the first time Fanny seemed to realize that Johnny had not
been with her for some time. She told Aunt that she had been
for two or three hours with the young gentleman who had warned
them on the train of Mr. Moses.</p>

<p>They waited and waited, growing more and more anxious about
Johnny.</p>

<p>"Yer, yer, yer, all of you, come on out!" They knew
Johnny's voice, and turned about just in time to see one of the
guards holding Johnny fast by the ear as they disappeared around
the corner of the wall and through the gates.</p>

<p>"There, you young scamp," as he gave Johnny an extra box
on the ear, "let me see you trying to sneak through the gates
again and you won't get off so easy."</p>

<p>"Well, ain't I been tellin' you fer an hour that the folks was a
waitin' fer me inside and you wouldn't tell 'em fur me," and
Johnny, with a disgusted shake of the head, joined the family as
they came out.</p>

<p>"Where on earth have you been?" said Uncle, in a chiding
tone of voice.</p>

<p>"Why, I came up to the gate about two hours ago and I seed
Louis Burjois here a-peekin' through, an' I come out and we've
been a-takin' in the circuses along Stony Island avenue.
Say, Gran'pa, I've engaged Louis fer bodyguard fer next week
when he comes back from his next run on the train. I gives
him a salary of goin' wheresomever I go."</p>

<p>Uncle looked at the boy standing by Johnny and recognized
him as the train-boy who had twice saved him from the loss of
money.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page43" id="page43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, Johnny," said Uncle, as he shook the train-boy's
hand, "how much extra allowance will that take?"</p>

<p>"Just double and a half for a regular time of it. You ought
to a seen us a doin' the side-shows. You see Louis knows 'em.
The fat woman is there, but not an ounce bigger than Sal Johnson
at Villaville, and she's part stuffed, for Louis stuck a pin in
her while she was asleep, and she never flinched. The sea monster
and the man with two bootblacks at each shoe, and just as
tall as the shoetops, is not much bigger than Bill Mason to hum.
And the four-legged woman is no good, fer Louis he pinched one
of them and it didn't kick, and the show that's got a man with
his body cut off just below his head is busted. You see Louis
said ef I'd pay the way in of half a dozen kids whut he picked
out and instructed, he'd bust the show and prove thet the man's

expense, and in we went. When they drawed the curtin up my
blood run cold fer there was a hed humping itself about on a
table and I could see clear under the table and there was no
body around there. I forgot to shoot, but Louis give the sign,
and all the rest just fired the peas at his head and he howled and
the head it shook awful ghastly, and then they all fired again,
and the head it jest raised right up and turned the table over and
shook, and the whole thing raised up and shook his fists at us
and then Louis said "jiggers," and you ought to have seen us a

Buffalo Bill's show. They was after us, but couldn't catch us."</p>

<p>"Johnny, Johnny," said Uncle sternly, "don't you know what
I've told you about letting other people's business alone?"</p>

<p>"But you see, grandpa, that was a fake and you know it's
everybody's duty to uproot the fakes."</p>

<p>"That's all right, Johnny," said Aunt, "You can uproot the
things needing uprooting on the farm but you must let Chicago
people uproot their own foolishness."</p>

<p>The sage advice was unheeded for Johnny was too full of the
day's adventures with his body guard and guide.</p>

<p>So far they had seen little of the city of Chicago, and it was
a great rest and pleasure for them to sit at the windows of their
rooms or in the balcony and look out over the busy street before
them or talk of the events of the day.</p>

<p>Uncle had gone ahead of the rest and taken his seat in a rocker
at their room window.</p>

<p>"O grandpa, there you are," called out Fanny's clear voice as
she entered the door and came quickly up to his side. "I ran
ahead, and grandma and Johnny are coming."</p>

<p><ins class="correction" title="original: incorrect opening quote before In">In</ins> her face was the sweet look of guileless girlhood, and her
dark hair waving back in the breeze coming through the window
crowned her sweet face with the tenderest beauty. Her eyes
were bright and sparkling with the interest and enthusiasm of
young life. They told of a woman's soul that would one day shine
out and help to make this bright world more bright and holy.</p>

<p>When the grandmother and Johnny joined them these four
stood there with no petty jealousies or bad feeling of any description
to mar their happiness as a family. The sinking sun came
out from the western clouds and lit up their faces as if they all
rested under God's smile of peace.</p>

<p>"Well, Fanny, I am closing my days on earth mighty satisfactory
to me. I have been mighty alarmed about what the "Zion's
Herald" said about the world's meanness, but I tell you what I

of the Lord in my soul in the last few days than I ever did before
in so many years. I've seen ribbons, and threshing machines
and wheat and corn for a long time but I never had any idea how
much brains people had before this. I went to some of the
farmer's meetings fer I felt oppressed myself and thought I was
just about doing it all myself but when I come here I see I haint
nowhere. I used to be afraid that the government was all a going
to pieces and that my fighting for the union and that the blood of
your Uncle Sam at Gettysburg was of no use but I ain't any more
now afraid of the world a bustin' up. People that made the
machinery that I've seen and all that have too much sense. My
mind is at rest now about all such things. When I seed the big

<p>A childish voice at the door broke their reverie.</p>

<p>Uncle Jeremiah having read all that interested him, turned
the paper over, when his eye fell on the columns of advertisements.
He had never read any of them before, and it attracted
his interest at once.</p>

<p>"Look hyar, Johnny! Here is a position you might git if you
had only done as I have teached and learnt your lesson at
school." And Uncle read, slowly:</p>

<p>"Grandpa, that is a sad reminder," said Fanny, as she came up
and looked over his shoulder at the paper.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because God loves a shining mark, and all those boys are
dead. On their tombs should be written: 'Here lies one who
lived not wisely, but too well.'"</p>

<p>"But, Fanny, where's the monkey to exchange?"</p>

<p>"Why, Johnny, of course. I know it would be a trade," she
said, rapturously.</p>

<p>Johnny had come up in the meantime, and was leaning on
Uncle's right shoulder. At Fanny's words he eyed her suspiciously
for a moment, and then, pointing his finger at another
advertisement, said: "Father, send Fanny to that place at once.
Her first meal will take the people a month to digest, and that
will be a big saving, for she won't have to make but one meal a

<p>Uncle crumpled the paper up in his hand and said emphatically,
"O you children git out."</p>

<p>But they felt more like talking as they were accustomed to do
of evenings at the farm. Johnny had told his adventures and Uncle
and Aunt had seen wonderful things which they knew were only
interesting to them. What they had seen was to them an awful
revelation of what the world was doing in the various lines of work
while the farmers were busy with the cares of the farm and isolated
from the great industries of life where genius subdues and
achieves.</p>

<p>"Somebody brought a heap of wool all the way from New South
Wales in Australia, and I felt ashamed of myself when I seed farm
products that was brought all the way from the Cape of Good
Hope and I hadn't brought nothing from Villaville. We seen
farmers from Japan, and China, and Ceylon. I was shocked to
see how them Japanese like to have snakes and hobgoblins a
crawling round their pavilions but when I seed the Americans
jammed all around when there was nicer products in the other
places, I just concluded that maybe after all it was our people that
liked 'em too, and so made 'em set the fashion here.</p>

<p>"The Canadians tried to beat everything with their twenty-two
thousand pound cheese. There is lots of fool extravagance in
that place but I guess it was necessary to show what we farmers
can do when we make up our minds."</p>

<p>Fanny told about meeting Mr. Blair and how interestingly he
explained everything. As she looked up at her Grandma, she
saw a troubled look on her face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page50" id="page50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's nothing," said Grandma, "but I didn't meet young folks
that way when I was a girl, and I am afeard now for you; but I've
always tried to teach you right, and I know no body can make
you believe I haven't teached you just right. I will trust ye. I
trusted your mamma when nobody else did, and she didn't do no
wrong."</p>

<p>Fanny went over and laid her cheek against her grandma's face
and whispered: "Grandma, any body can kill me, but nobody
can make me wilfully do wrong."</p>

<span class="caption">"THERE WAS A MEDLEY OF EXCITED VOICES."</span>
</div>

<p>Several unnoteworthy days were spent by Uncle and his
family in which they saw through the official buildings of the
states and nations; through the Forestry building, showing the
forestry wealth of the world; through the leather exhibits, showing
the wonders done to the skins of beasts; all over Wooded
Island, with its curiosities of Davy Crockett's cabin and the Javanese
Hooden; through the clam bakes and the Casino, with the
miscellaneous objects of interest about them. Uncle thought he
was entering the Liberal Arts building when he walked past the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page52" id="page52">[Pg 52]</a></span>

guard at the southeast entrance of the Casino. He wandered
into a labyrinth of side-rooms, where he heard an amazing medley
of excited voices in as many different languages. They were
evidently quarreling over something that displeased them very
much. Presently a guard caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Are you a musician, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, I used ter play a Jew's harp a leetle."</p>

<p>"The Casino will open again at three o'clock. You are not
allowed in here."</p>

<p>The rest of the family had remained on the outside, suspicious
of Uncle's venture. As he returned, led out in rather an undignified
way by the guard, Uncle did not relish the amused looks of
his family and the casual observers.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha," yelled Johnny in glee, "Grandpa's the first of us to
get took by the cop. I'll tell everybody at Villaville about you
getting led out."</p>

<p>From here they went on around to the north end of the greatest
building on the grounds where were stored the miscellaneous educational
achievements of the world.</p>

<p>As they entered the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts building
through one of the small entrances on the north, the greatness of
that more than forty-four acres of exhibits did not impress itself
upon them. The first objects that met their gaze were the
graphophones or phonographs. Some nickles were soon in the
slots and the family for the first time listening to music coming
from some where by singers unseen. Johnny had a face covered
with smiles as he listened to some loud-mouthed artist singing
"Throw him down McClosky." Between each verse Johnny
told the boy who stood in open-mouthed wonder near him that the
"feller is a singer from way back." He could not realize that he
was not in a concert hall and that all standing about were not
hearing what he heard. When the music ceased and he withdrew

the tubes from his ears he said to the boy, "Wasn't that out of
sight?"</p>

<p>"Sure, and out of my hearing too, but I guess I got a nickle
to try it <ins class="correction" title="original: comma missing">on,</ins>" and his nickle disappeared in the slot and the unwearied
singer hid away in the machine told again his story of the
great fight.</p>

<p>When Uncle took the tubes from his ears his eyes were full of
tears.</p>

<p>"Why, Grandpa, what's the matter?" asked Fanny who had
just listened to some selection by the Marine band.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I heard something that I used to hear long
time ago, and I couldn't tell just who was a singin' it to me. It
was some woman, though, and I let myself think it was somebody
else, and I was a thankin' God for lettin' me hear her once
more. I thought it was Mary singin' "Old Folks at Home"
for me, jest like she used to, and I thought for a while that she
had come back to me. I wanted to talk to her, and it hurt me
when I seed that I couldn't."</p>

<p>There was a stairway near by, and Fanny suggested that they
should first go above. They came to the place where they could
look out into the main floor. They were near the great clock
tower just as the chimes began to peal forth their weird melodies.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Aunt, in awe-struck tones.</p>

<p>"It's the chime of the bells," cried Fanny, in delight, "listen!
listen!"</p>

<p>Clear and plain through the vast building and to the streets on
the outside came the slow measured notes of that nation-thrilling
air, "My Country, 'tis of Thee."</p>

<p>All stood entranced before a scene never before reached by
human means. When the chimes were done, Uncle said: "Let
us go down to the main floor. I want to walk from end to tother
of that aisle."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page56" id="page56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Johnny held in each hand a camp-stool for Uncle and Aunt,
and he arranged the stools for them to sit awhile before that
wonderful scene. Not long after, they were marching down that
aisle called Columbia avenue. They felt themselves every inch
as citizens of a great republic. It is not a very long thoroughfare&mdash;only
a third of a mile&mdash;but they were two hours on the
way. Uncle was a common, everyday American citizen when he
started. At each step it seemed to him he swelled in his own
estimation. At the clock tower he was proud enough to ascend
that structure and make a Fourth of July speech. At the end of
his walk he wanted to wear an eagle on his hat and shout till his
throat should be stiff. It was not solely as an American that he
was filled with exultation but as a member of the human race.
He was lifted up with pride in the achievements of his fellow-man
and in satisfaction that his own country was the host of such
a splendid company.</p>

<p>Columbia avenue is the broad thoroughfare which traverses the
center of the greatest building that ever was. It runs through
the Manufactures and Liberal Arts building from the grand court
to the plaza at the northern end. A walk down this thoroughfare
is like a tour of the world in sixty minutes. Though, if you are
to do it in sixty minutes, you must fifty times repress an impulse
to linger beside some new marvel in the handiwork of man and
go marching on. You cannot beat the record in a trip around the
world and stop and see all the grand cathedrals and picturesque
ruins and beautiful women and inviting galleries of art.</p>

<p>Columbia avenue is a picture never to be surpassed. It is a
cleanly and an attractive thoroughfare for the world of tourists
who throng the way. The path is no longer littered with lumber
and boxes and kegs of paints. The horizon&mdash;for this vast enclosure
has its horizon&mdash;is no more filled with a fine, white mist

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page57" id="page57">[Pg 57]</a></span>

rising from the efforts of workmen to push and chisel blocks
of staff into their appropriate places. It is a colossal field of process
and a panorama of result. The world can not produce a
more noble and inspiring place. It is the avenue down which
the man on whom fate has fallen and whose steps in this world
are few should choose to expend the last remaining atoms of his
strength.</p>

<p>Uncle, as an American citizen, came in pride and exultation
into the avenue from the central court. He had not been there
before. The first thing he did was to stand fully five minutes
gazing at the immensity of the enclosure trying to comprehend it,
instinctively but vainly seeking adjectives with which to characterize
it, and finally giving it all up, as a man gives up trying to
measure the ocean or count the stars, conceding it to be too vast
and wonderful for the range alike of his vision and his mind. No
one told him which way to go, but away over his head, he couldn't
guess how many hundred feet, was a line of pendent stars and
stripes extending so far in a perspective of red and white that he
could not see the fartherest. For aught he knew to the contrary
the line led away to the sunny South. But knowing that where
the stars and stripes led the way, he could go as he had done in
the years of war, he passed on through a maze of wonders greater
than even a Solomon could dream.</p>

<p>Not a word had been spoken for some time. Fanny had
stopped at a millinery booth.</p>

<p>"Well, now come on Fanny, you wouldn't let me look at them
harrows to my heart's content so come on, for you might get
ideas into your head that would cost me lots of money and you
know these times are expensive enough anyhow."</p>

<p>At the south end of the hall they ascended to the galleries
again and soon, came past the educational exhibits that cover

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page58" id="page58">[Pg 58]</a></span>

every department of human training. There was a booth of
educational temperance. Here they read:</p>

<table summary="banner" cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td class="footnotes" align="center"><i>The Star of Hope</i><br /><i>of the Temperance Reform</i><br /><i>stands over the</i><br /><i>School House</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>These letters were on a banner of beautifully wrought silk, and
near by was a map of the United States, with seven states distinguished
from the rest by being in the darkest black.</p>

<p>"Those states," explained the ladies in charge, "have no
school legislation for teaching temperance."</p>

<p>"Yes," soliloquized Uncle, "the school house, the pulpit and
the press, are the three forces of freedom and progress in our
welfare, but our lives and our natures are not alone molded by
these. The fathers and mothers in the home holds greater destinies
for the world than all the rest of the forces of the earth
together." Then they went through a modeling department.
Uncle could not see any use of these things.</p>

<p>"Now, Fanny, I'm tired of these mixing wax and realities
together. Here's a man's head four feet across in this glass
case. What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"O, that's just an enlarged figure to show the anatomy."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't come here to see 'natomy, so let's pass on
and leave it to other folks that like sich."</p>

<p>Just then some good country people came up and they were
almost wild for knowledge as to where the Exposition people dug
up that awful giant, and as to how long he lived before the flood,
and if it might not be Goilah. Fanny could not stand such an
error, and she pointed out to the little girl the card below

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page59" id="page59">[Pg 59]</a></span>

explaining what the figure intended to show.</p>

<p>They went on past states and foreign countries, and booth
after booth of books and papers of the great publishing companies.</p>

<p>"Come here, come this way, all of ye!"</p>

<p>Johnny was wildly motioning to his folks, who had stopped to
examine some books in a booth near the north end of the Liberal
Arts hall. As they came up to him, he said: "Say, you remember
the Century plant, don't you, down in the Horticultural
hall, wot's jest bloomed? Well, I've found a Century company,
an' I want Fanny to go in thar an' ask the gurl wot hes charge if
we kin see it bloomin'."</p>

<p>"They are the people who publish so much about the war
and about Lincoln. Let us go in and I'll take some notes
about what they have."</p>

<p>Fanny took out her pencil and notebook as they approached
the entrance of the booth. All went in together, and the lady
in charge, seeing Fanny with a notebook in her hand, came over
to her from the opposite side of the room with a rush that
almost took the young observer's breath away.</p>

<p>"Are you a reporter, Miss?"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Fanny.</p>

<p>"Oh! Just taking notes for your own amusement."</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly that. I may use them some time."</p>

<p>Fanny had in mind the things she would have to tell to her
less fortunate friends at home.</p>

<p>"O I see, going to weave them into a book or a lecture. Just
come this way;" and, followed by Johnny, Uncle and Aunt,
Fanny went the rounds of the place listening attentively to the
interesting talk of the lady in charge as she explained the processes
in detail of making a great magazine, the evolution of the
English dictionary and of dictionary making in all its phases. She

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page60" id="page60">[Pg 60]</a></span>

showed them many interesting relics and among them the original
letters and documents of the company's great war articles
and their life of the martyred president. The lady never had
more interested listeners or people more grateful for the trouble
she had taken to instruct them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/image21.jpg" width="363" height="312" alt="image21" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"UNCLE DID NOT RECOGNIZE HIM."</span>
</div>

<p>"No, don't go till you have registered."</p>

<p>Fanny went over and registered for all of them and Uncle went
away feeling as if he now had a literary education and could write
anything from a war article to a dictionary.</p>

<p>They passed on down and out of the building more impressed
than ever concerning the greatness of the world. Aunt rarely said
much but now she remarked that she loved their farm and their
Jerseys more than ever but she could see that God's mercies and

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page61" id="page61">[Pg 61]</a></span>

blessings did not rest alone on them and their neighbors. There
was indeed a world beyond what she had ever seen or been able
to dream.</p>

<p>As they passed on to the gate a family evidently from off the
farm passed them.</p>

<p>The eyes of Uncle and the farmer happened to meet and the
farmer nodded to him.</p>

<p>"Now look at <ins class="correction" title="original: comma missing">that,</ins>" exclaimed Uncle. "How cityfied I'm
getting. I didn't nod to that feller. The fust few days I was
here I nodded to everybody who looked at me but when they
stared back at me like I was an idiot, I quit."</p>

<p>As they came by the Administration building a gentleman passed
near them and politely lifted his hat. Without response Aunt and
Fanny went on but Uncle grasped the gentleman by the <ins class="correction" title="original: hand hand">hand</ins>
and said, "Mr. Moses, I am so glad to see you. I ain't
been tuck up yet by the perlice nor lost any money but I guess I
would if you hadn't give me such good advice."</p>

<p>"Uncle, I must tell you that my name is Warner, as you have it
on my card and not Moses. I told you that name just for a joke
because I didn't expect to see you again and you know we don't
often tell our names and business to people we meet on the
trains."</p>

<p>Uncle was very much troubled. He could not see any joke in
a false name being given. He remembered then that Fanny said
a young man on the train was shadowing Mr. Moses, and this false
name made it look bad for Mr. Warner.</p>

<p>"Well Mr. Warner I am sorry you deceived me for I liked you
very much and I aimed to call on you, but maybe I hadn't orter
not."</p>

<p>Without another ward Uncle went on to join his waiting family,
sadly shaking his head as he thought of the misplaced confidence
he had bestowed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page62" id="page62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"There," said Mr. Warner, "I have estranged the good opinion
of the old man and in his mind made the words of the confidence
man seem true. But somehow I feel sure that I shall meet her
in a different way."</p>

<p>As he looked after her he said, "There goes the dearest girl
on earth to me."</p>

<span class="caption">"HE LOOKED AROUND AFTER HER."</span>
</div>

<p>It was arranged that the next day the old people should rest at
their hotel all day and at two o'clock Fanny would go to one of
the big retail stores to do some needful shopping with Johnny as
an escort.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER VI</i></h2>

<h4>DANGERS OF THE GREAT CITY</h4>

<p>Johnny was listlessly walking along in front of Dearborn Station,
on Polk street, when he saw some fine looking apples on
one of the fruit stands. Instantly the old orchard at home came
into his mind, and with it a hunger for apples that could not be
downed. Fishing up a dime from his pocket, it was not long till
two apples were his, one of them undergoing a carving that only
a country boy hungry for apples could perform. As he turned the
corner he passed a number of bootblacks tossing pennies to the
edge of the curbing, the one lodging his penny nearest the edge
winning all the other pennies. Johnny watched them long enough
to understand their gambling game and then moved on.</p>

<p>"Hi ther, kids," said one, "watch me git a free lunch."</p>

<p>He came quickly up behind the unsuspecting boy and struck
one of the apples out of his hand. But before he could pick it
up, Johnny gave him a shove that sent him sprawling in the
mud. Johnny stooped to regain his apple, but half a dozen of the
other boys ran up and began striking him from all sides. His
knife was open in his hand, and some one struck him a blow on
the hand that knocked the knife into the gutter. Warding off the
uncomfortable blows as fast as he could, he ran to get his knife.
In an instant he was tripped down upon his face with half a dozen
boys cuffing him about the head and shoulders.</p>

<p>"What you skates a-doin' there. Come off now; let a feller
have a show!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page64" id="page64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys were thrust back, and Johnny scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p>"Hello! If it ain't de kid wot's got de purty sister an' helped
me to pepper de fake on Stony Island avenoo. Bin a-crapin',
have ye, an' them fellers wuz a-doing ye up." It was the train-boy
who had been of such service to Johnny's grandfather as they
came into the city.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/image23.jpg" width="362" height="344" alt="image23" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"BEEN A CRAPIN', HAVE YE!"</span>
</div>

<p>Johnny explained how it all happened, and they went away from
the crowd. Johnny's clothes were soiled and his knife and apples
were gone, but he was glad to get out of such a rough crowd.</p>

<p>"Where wuz ye goin'?"</p>

<p>"I've got an hour yet, when I am to meet Fanny at the north

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page65" id="page65">[Pg 65]</a></span>

entrance to the store she's tradin' at. I couldn't stand taggin'
after her, so she let me go."</p>

<p>Johnny had wandered from the store into the neighborhood of
one of the most disreputable places in the city. He and his
friend were coming up the street when the train-boy exclaimed:
"Hi, thar, wot's yer sis doin' on dis devilish street wid dat thief
<ins class="correction" title="original: closing quote missing">yonder?"</ins></p>

<p>Johnny looked where the boy was pointing, and, sure enough,
Johnny saw his sister being escorted along the street by Mr.
Blair, who had spoken to them of Mr. Moses on the train, and
who had been with Fanny one day at the Fair.</p>

<p>"Why, ain't he all right," said John.</p>

<p>"Nary all right. Wusn't he helping to rob your grandad as he
was a coming out of the train, and did'nt I nab his pal with the
wad of stuff in his hand? He works with the feller what give yer
old dad the short change."</p>

<p>Johnny would have started on a run after his sister but Louis
said, "Hold on pard, I'm a running this. Ef your sis is all right,
that feller is liable to git to travel over the road fer it. I've got it
in fer that feller and you see if I don't git him pulled. I tell you
if he gits your sis into one of them houses, she'll never come out
alive fer she'll kill herself."</p>

<p>Johnny was white with fright but Louis laid his hand on Johnny's
shoulder and said: "Now you watch the show."</p>

<p>A policeman was at the next corner and Louis walked up to
him with the air of one who had a most important communication
to make.</p>

<p>"Me name is Louis Burjois, and dis is de brudder of dat gal
wot you see walkin' over dere. She is an innercent gal, which
dat feller is a-tollin' of her off. He's a pickpocket, and I'm one
wot kin swear to it. We want him arrested an' jugged. We'll
see to all de responsibility."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page66" id="page66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, you Arabs don't take me in that way. Git out. The gal
knows her biz."</p>

<p>By this time Louis saw that the confidence man had stopped
at one of the most prepossessing houses on the street. It was
also one of the vilest and most dangerous places in the city. The
door-bell had been rung, and there was not a moment to lose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/image24.jpg" width="346" height="329" alt="image24" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"SHE'S AN INNERCENT GIRL WHAT'S A GITTIN' TOLLED OFF."</span>
</div>

<p>"For God's sake run and yell!" and he gave Johnny a push
in their direction, which was all he needed to send him flying up
the street yelling and waving his hat and calling "Fanny! Fanny!
Fanny!" like a boy gone mad.</p>

<p>The door had opened and Fanny was about to step inside, when

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page67" id="page67">[Pg 67]</a></span>

she heard her name called. She turned around, but the young
man crowded up behind her.</p>

<p>"Who is calling me?" she said. "It must be Johnny. Yes,
it's his voice."</p>

<p>"No, it's only a bootblack," her companion said, harshly and
excitedly.</p>

<p>"I know its Johnny," and she dodged by him out of the door.
He tried to catch her by the arm, but, missing that, seized her
dress, nearly tearing it off of her waist. At this moment Johnny
dashed up, and, throwing his arms around her, cried: "O Fanny!
Fanny! come quick! come away! don't wait a minute!" and
he fairly dragged her to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>The young man disappeared through the door but not before he
saw Louis come running up and shaking his fist at him yelling at
the top of his voice, "O you horrible old cheese, I'll get your mug
behind the bars some of these days in spite of yourself."</p>

<p>The policeman was placidly watching the scene, but concluding
at last that something unusual was happening he came up and
went into the house. A few minutes after he came out alone
and walked measuredly on toward the end of his beat.</p>

<p>Fanny in the meantime had pinned her dress and was walking
away with the two boys. She was not less excited than they
were.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? I can't think. What has happened;
there must be something awfully wrong."</p>

<p>"Well, you see, miss, that feller is the pall of the man what
tried to rob your grandad and he was a taking of you to one of
the worstestes places in Chicago."</p>

<p>"Why he showed me his detective star and also papers and
business cards the other day at the Fair. I met him this time in
the store. While we were talking there he showed me a blue
book which he said was a list of the best society of Chicago, and

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page68" id="page68">[Pg 68]</a></span>

he showed me his name and his sisters'. I didn't know anything
how to trade at the big stores and he said it would please him so
much to take me and introduce me to his mother and sisters, who
lived only three or four blocks away, and one of his sisters would
come back with me and I could do my trading in half the time
and to so much better advantage. He talked so nicely that I
didn't see how I could refuse to go."</p>

<p>"That's the chap exactly. He's a bad man, and I'm a going
to run him in yet."</p>

<p>Louis gave a self satisfied toss of the head, clinched his fists
and said, "Its lucky, awful lucky that I seed ye." Fanny shuddered
and she whispered a fervent prayer of thankfulness.</p>

<p>They had now arrived at the store and Louis acted as ready
escort to the various booths where Fanny desired to trade.</p>

<p>"Don't you forgit that you have to meet me at the Sixtieth
street gate at nine o'clock next Monday morning for to be my
body guard the whole week and I think I can get our grandpa to
throw in about two dollars a day for ye for general services. Anyhow,
I don't see how any of us can feel safe any more without
you being around. I expect if you come out to our farm, I'd save
your life about a dozen times a day for the first week, you'd need
me around pretty bad for the first month."</p>

<p>"It's very glad I am that I struck you," said Louis, "for my
dad got killed cause he stuck by his engine and I have to help
the folks so much that I couldn't get into the Fair only by scheming
somehow, and I might not hit the combination."</p>

<p>Fanny and Johnny, still bewildered over their adventures, now
took a cable car and in a little while were telling their astonished
grandparents about their day's experiences and Fanny's wonderful
escape from the confidence man. Uncle could not remember
Mr. Blair, but it was a good occasion for one of his impressive
lectures on the providence of God.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page69" id="page69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>It was an evening for the electric display at the grounds and at
eight o'clock they were seated near the statue of the Republic on
the south side of the basin waiting to see the crowning achievement
of modern intellect.</p>

<p>No wonder that the papers of the next morning spoke of the
"White City in a blaze of glory," and that "thousands viewed
the sight, entranced with the marvelous exhibition." It was a
sight to inspire the writers of the day, and of all the descriptions
that Fanny culled none were more appropriate for recalling the
memories of what she saw, and to record what she had experienced,
than the reportorial sketches of this night. The hour
approached for the most wonderful illumination since God said:
"Let there be light."</p>

<p>Slowly night came on, and slowly night was turned back into
day. A few stars came out and shone for a little while, and then
disappeared from man because of the blaze of light he was in.</p>

<p>To the north and west a heavy pall of smoke brooded over the
city. Above it a broad band of gorgeous crimson, shot with
purple and yellow, marked the dying glories of the day. Overhead
scattered clouds floated against a gray sky, and through
them yellow stars were shining. Looking down into the grand
basin the white walls of the palaces which bound it loomed gray
and ghostly. On the southern horizon the chimneys of a blast
furnace belched their red flames high into the darkness.</p>

<p>One by one white globes of light glittered about the graceful
sweep of the basin. They cast deep black shadows on the walls
behind them, and threw burnished, rippling ribbons over the
dark water below. The broad avenue leading to the north between
the Mines and Mining and the Electricity buildings grew
brilliant on either side. At its far northern end a clump of
tangled shrubbery lay in heavy shadow, and still beyond, stretching
away for miles, a hundred thousand scattered yellow sparks told

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page70" id="page70">[Pg 70]</a></span>

that the great city was awake. Far off on the dark lagoon, men
were singing, and the echo of their voices rose faintly through
the silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly a single beam of yellow light, like a falling star, flickered
and grew bright on the high dome of the Administration
building. Then lines of fire ran down its splendid sweep, and
outlined in flame it stood out in splendor against the night. About
its base circled a wheel of light, while above a hundred torches
flared into the darkness. Within the great buildings about the
basin electric coronas were ablaze and the giant pillars of the colonnades
loomed white against the shadows. From their caps
huge figures of the arts of peace leaned out over the black abyss
beneath. Along the top of the peristyle flickered a yellow ribbon
of flame, and above, dim and gray against the sky, senators and
heathen gods look down upon the glory.</p>

<p>Between these lay the dark waters of the basin, seamed with
faint, waving bars of light. Over them, like long black shadows,
graceful gondolas slipped in silence, and electric launches with
their fiery eyes crept across the vista.</p>

<p>From the roof of Music hall a wide pyramid of fierce white
light was thrown upon the Administration dome. Its blazonry of
yellow died away, and under the new glare the delicate, lace-like
tracery of gold and white was brought into strong relief. From
the roofs of the buildings of Manufactures and Agriculture twin
search-lights beat down upon the MacMonnies fountain. Behind
it the plaza was black with men, and its pure white figures
shone as if carved from Parian marble.</p>

<p>Then the light was changed, and in a glory of crimson the ship
Columbia, with its white-armed rowers, sailed on before the
people. From his high pillar on either side, Neptune, leaning on
his trident, looked down serenely. The search-lights swept the
horizon, and for a moment graceful Diana loomed against the sky

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page71" id="page71">[Pg 71]</a></span>

like a figure suspended in midair. At the east end of the basin
the Golden Republic glittered against the night, lifting her golden
eagle high above the crowd. Smoke from a passing engine rose
about the dome of the Administration building, and its fiery outlines
flickered and grew faint. The triumphant goddess seated
high on the galley in the central fountain was bathed in a glory
of green fire, and then yellow, changing again to its spotless
white.</p>

<p>Under the great central entrance to Electricity building stood
all the while the figure of an old-time Quaker. His eyes looked
upward, and he held in his hand the feeble instrument which
made possible the glories of this night. Franklin, with his kite,
looked out upon the consummation of what he dreamt of when
he drew lightning from the summer cloud. For two hours the
"White City" blossomed in new beauty. The great basin was
bathed in a flood of fairy moonlight. Outside the peristyle the
lake beat its monotone against the walls. On the plaza the great
orchestra of more than 100 men played patriotic music, and the
people were filled and lifted with the spirit of the night.</p>

<p>The search light was a great surprise. It went dancing along
the fronts of opposite buildings, climbed up the towers and brought
out golden Diana. It flashed against the statue of the Republic,
and kept it for a full minute resplendent as though carved from a
block of flame and then flickered away, leaving the great figure
in twilight uncertainty. After a time three irregular splashes of
light were playing hide-and-seek along the basin and up the fronts
of the big building. The lights changed their colors. Sometimes
they were green and again they were blue or red.</p>

<p>While several thousand people were admiring this picture, a
rocket of light shone out from one of the high corners of the
agriculture building and flooded the MacMonnies fountain in a
whiteness which made all the other light seem dim and lifeless.

Under its focus the golden caravels and the draped figures
showed strange contrasts of chalky pallor and deep shade. Only
a moment later a second bar of light leaped out from a sky-high
nook of the Manufactures building and swept the surface of the
basin. It struck a moving gondola, and in a flash showed the gay
Venetians bending to their long oars, the bright colors of the
boat and the muffled forms of the passengers.</p>

<p>Johnny had left the others absorbed in their trance of delight.
He sought other sights. Directly he came to the Electricity
building, with its marvels of light. It burst on his childish mind,
seeking for novelties, as greater than the scenes outside. It was
something that Fanny and Uncle and Aunt must see. He ran in
the greatest haste to bring them. When they came in, Johnny
showed them where to sit to see the great illumination in the
center of the building. It was then quite dark about them, but
Johnny knew the marvelous sight he had said was there would
soon appear.</p>

<p>Four rows of colored bulbs containing incandescent lights and
placed on zig-zag frame works forty feet long in different directions
are about a pillar around which are twined strings of two
thousand electric bulbs of red, white and blue. The pillar is
covered with bits of reflecting colored glass, thus making a magic
intermingling of lights that almost rival the lightning in startling
brilliancy and produce a pillar of fire scarcely surpassed even by
that one which led the Israelites across the sea.</p>

<p>When the illumination came the weird ingenuity of the electric
magicians struck Aunt Sarah with a sublimity almost more than
she could endure. As the flashes of light struck out about the
pillar and the ball of fire fell as if dropped from some creating
hand she screamed, "O my God, what blasphemy is this that
men have achieved. Can they snatch the fire from heaven and
make the lightening a plaything?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page73" id="page73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>She sank upon a chair and gazed stupefied for some minutes
at the awful scene. Then as they passed on she said, "I have
seen the wonderful machinery great and small. I have seen the
old relics which they say are the remains of men's hopes long
gone by, but when man can take the light
that comes out from the storms and put it
up for show, it seems to me that I am seeing
forbidden things and that the skill of
men has gone too far."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 130px;">

<span class="caption">"The light shot across the sky."</span>
</div>

<p>At the next flash from the tower there
was a shriek and a crowd began to gather
about a man just across the hall. The cry
came from a man who could receive the
terrible grandeur but he did not have the
strength of mind to sustain it.</p>

<p>He was gazing upon the incandescent
globe-studded column, as in a trance, and
again one of the electricians turned on the
current and the shaft changed to living fire. The man seemed
horrified by the unearthly beauty of the spectacle. It continued but
a minute, when the current was turned off and the blinding light
disappeared almost as suddenly as it had come.</p>

<p>A bystander whose attention happened to be directed toward
him says that he stood gazing at the column for fully three minutes
after the light had been turned off and that his countenance
betrayed overwhelming bewilderment. Once or twice he raised
a hand and drew it across his forehead. Then he was seen to
press his temples with both palms, all the while gazing in an awe-stricken
way at the great pillar. The attention of several visitors
was attracted to the farmer, and one of them stepped to his side
to inquire if anything was wrong with him. As the gentleman
reached his side the latter threw his arms upward and, with a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page74" id="page74">[Pg 74]</a></span>

shriek that started the echoes, fell forward upon his face. Two or
three guards rushed to the prostrate man's assistance, but before
they reached his side he leaped to his feet and, screaming at the
top of his voice, ran through the aisle toward the entrance facing
the lagoon.</p>

<p>In a moment all was excitement, and the great crowd of
visitors, becoming panic-stricken, ran in a dozen different directions
or hid behind exhibits. The madman, pursued by a half-dozen
guards, dashed down a side aisle and, leaping over boxes
and machines, made a complete circuit of the General Electric
company's exhibit and then paused again before the central
column. Two guards seized him, but he threw them off as
though they had been infants and again he started on a wild
hurdle race through the building. He had not gone far when he
tripped and fell, and in a moment three bluecoats were upon him.</p>

<p>Struggling and shrieking, the poor man was half led, half carried,
to the north entrance of the building, where was waiting a
patrol wagon. It required the combined strength of five guards to
get the unfortunate man into the patrol wagon. Throughout the
short drive to the patrol barn the prisoner fought like a wild animal
and the officers had their hands full in keeping him aboard. When
brought before the sergeant the prisoner became exceedingly
quiet and spoke rationally while giving his name and address.</p>

<p>One of the guards then began to detail the offense of the prisoner.
The recital had but just begun when the man became
greatly excited and began screaming once more. The sergeant
placed his hand in a kindly way upon his shoulder and gently forced
him into a chair. The man grew quiet again and listened to the
guard relate the story of the arrest without interruption. When
the officer had finished the man arose and, walking up to the sergeant,
said:</p>

<p>"Don't harm me, I didn't put all those bottles there. I'll tell

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page75" id="page75">[Pg 75]</a></span>

you how it was. Somebody has stuck those bottles on that post
and covered them up with a white cloth. When they raised the
cloth the bottles turned to fire. I am not to blame. I don't
know how those bottles came there. There are millions of them.
They were all right at first, but the devils poured red fire into
them. Don't hurt me. I had nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>The sergeant talked kindly to the man, and when he was
quieted led him to the hospital, where a doctor attended to him.
Here he entered into a long description of the pillar of "bottles,"
by which he evidently meant the incandescent globes. The doctor
gave his patient a quieting potion, and in a short time
he fell into a sleep. When he awoke from his sleep he was
quiet, but his mind still dwelt on the pillar of "bottles," and
he insisted on repeating his version of the affair to all the
doctors. In the evening a carriage took the patient away, supposedly
to the detention hospital.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER VII</i></h2>

<h4>ON BOARD THE "ILLINOIS"</h4>

<p>"Now for the battleship," said Johnny, "that's what I want to
see." As they came on board the brick ship, the first words they
heard were quite nautical.</p>

<p>"It's eight bells."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir!"</p>

<p>The bos'un, or whoever it was that received the order from the
Lieutenant, climbed up and tapped out eight strokes on the big
brass bell. About twenty people, with lunch baskets and camp-chairs,
ran after him and watched the performance.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" asked a young woman.</p>

<p>"That <ins class="correction" title="original: tell's">tells</ins> the time of day," answered her escort.</p>

<p>"But it's after 12 o'clock by my watch and he struck it only
eight times."</p>

<p>"Well, they&mdash;ah&mdash;they have a system of their own. It's very
complicated."</p>

<p>"Look at that crooked thing there," said one of the visitors,
pointing to the air-tube leading to the stoker. "Is that their
foghorn I've heerd about?"</p>

<p>"They don't need no foghorns on warships. I jedge it's a
shootin'-iron of some kind or other, maybe a gattlin' gun what
jest blows the shot out. You see it's pointin' out like at an
enemy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page77" id="page77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>An elderly woman stepped up to the Lieutenant and said: "I'd
like mighty well to see some of the Gatling guns."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, you will find them at the foretop."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"At the turret in the fore-top."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">
<img src="images/image26.jpg" width="373" height="317" alt="image26" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"MAYBE ITS A FOG HORN, OR A GATLING GUN."</span>
</div>

<p>"Do you mean up in the little round cupola?"</p>

<p>"Cupola, great heavens," murmured the officer under his
breath. Then he called a marine and had him show the woman
to the fore-top. It is the experience of a lifetime for a naval
officer who has cruised in the Mediterranean and rocked over the
high waves of the south Atlantic to be placed in command of a
brick battleship, which rests peacefully alongside a little pier and

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page78" id="page78">[Pg 78]</a></span>

is boarded by hundreds of reckless sight-seers every day. The
conning towers are of sheet-iron and some of the formidable guns
are simply painted wood. It is said that if anything larger than a
six-inch gun should be fired from the deck of the mimic battleship
the recoil would upset the masonry and jolt the whole structure
into a shapeless mass.</p>

<p>Below the water line the Illinois is a hollow mockery, but the
two decks, the turrets and the heavy battery are made so realistic
that any one who had not seen the brick laid and the plating put
on might suppose it was a real war vessel that had stranded well
in toward the beach. As a matter of fact, about one-third of the
visitors are deceived, which fact may be vouched for by any one
of the marines parading the deck. A man who looked as though
he read the newspapers, called a sergeant of marines "Cap," and
remarked that it was a very fine vessel.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, sir," replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>"She'll be here all summer, will she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Did this boat take part in the review at New York?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; this battleship is stuck fast here. It is a shell of
brick, built up from a stone foundation, and is intended to represent
a model battleship."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me. Made of brick, eh?" Uncle, listening
to the talk, shared the countryman's disgust.</p>

<p>"There, Fanny, how do you excuse them for that piece of
mockery? Everybody getting fooled as if they were in a cheap
dime show. It's too bad the government should be a partner to
sich deceptions. And then just hear them fellows making fun o'
the likes o' us. It's a shame. Of course we hev to ask questions
when they use all the art in the world to make deceiving
things and then make fun if they do such good work as to fool
us. We don't know any more about their work than they do

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page79" id="page79">[Pg 79]</a></span>

about our farm. I guess they couldn't tell a Jersey from a
short-horn, nor a header from a clover-huller."</p>

<p>One of the sailors was telling of the questions asked by the
public. Some person asked him if the gulls flying around the
ship were sea-gulls, and whether they had been brought on especially
for the Fair. Another asked why the guns were plugged up at
the end with pieces of wood. A marine said the plugs of wood
made them air-tight, so that they wouldn't sink if they fell overboard.
Maybe the man believed it. He didn't say anything.</p>

<p>From sight-seeing at the ship they came over to the Fisheries
building.</p>

<p>The throng of visitors here at first detracted their sight from
the wall of fish and wonders of the sea around them.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Aunt when she looked about, "I nearly have to
gasp to make sure I'm not at the bottom of the sea. Just look
at them fish swimming around on both sides of you."</p>

<p>"Well I feel sorry for these poor fish, they look so tired," said
Fanny, "but it's very evident they can't keep lively all the time."</p>

<p>One of the big scaly-backed tarpons in the fountain was fanning
his tail and moving slowly through the water. On the
railing at the edge of the pool sat a tired man with a baby hanging
over his arm. If the tarpon had stuck his nose out of the
water he could have grabbed the man by the coat-tail and pulled
him backward. The mother was standing a few feet away. She
turned around and saw two beady eyes shining up through the
water.</p>

<p>"Hold tight to that child," she said. "If you ever drop him
that big pike would gobble him right up."</p>

<p>"He don't eat babies," replied the husband, calmly. "Besides,
it ain't a pike; it's a sturgeon."</p>

<p>"Well, he looks awful mean, anyway." The husband, merely
to reassure her, moved a few feet further along and let the baby

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page80" id="page80">[Pg 80]</a></span>

lie over his shoulder and watch the little fish chase one another.
The aisles were crowded full of people, who had found that a
visit to the east end of the Fisheries building was almost as good
as a dive to the bottom of the ocean.</p>

<p>It is in this place where you may stand with coral reefs and
ring-tailed shells on either side and watch strange fish with spikes
on their backs open their mouths and gape until each one looks
like the letter O. The sea turtles stand on their heads and wave
yellow flippers at the wide-eyed crowd, and a devil crab makes all
the women shiver and pull the children away from the glass. In
one aquarium there are so many catfish that they make the water
cloudy.</p>

<p>In front of one of the cases there was a learned discussion.
The label simply said "Anemone." On the rocks and shells
were some things shaped like stars and mushrooms, except that
they were moss-colored and had whiskers floating out in the
water. "Annymone, what the dickens are they?" asked a man
with a linen duster.</p>

<p>"Some kind of sea-weed, I believe," said an elderly gentleman
in a patronizing manner.</p>

<p>"No, they ain't they're animals, broke in a third.</p>

<p>"But, sir, they are stuck fast there and can't move," said the
elderly gentleman.</p>

<p>"I know that but they reach out with those whiskers and grab
stuff and feed themselves that way."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the first time I ever heard of anything feedin'
itself with its whiskers."</p>

<p>One of the young women looked at the sheepshead aquarium
and murmured: "What long bills they have." Her escort
<ins class="correction" title="original: smilled">smiled</ins> in a knowing way and said: "That is not a bill; that is
a proboscis, I believe. I wish I had a hook and line."</p>

<p>A Columbian guard said he was tired of hearing the same old

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page81" id="page81">[Pg 81]</a></span>

jokes, for nearly every young man who came in with a girl said:
"When I come back here I'll bring a hook and line."</p>

<p>They finished the day here, and wearied with the noise and
tumult of the streets were glad to find rest in their rooms when
evening came.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/image27.jpg" width="362" height="339" alt="image27" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"NEXT TIME I'LL BRING A HOOK AND LINE."</span>
</div>

<p>The sweetness of this rural family was nowhere better to be
seen than when they were resting at home in the evening after
the fatiguing experiences of the day.</p>

<p>"Grandpa," said Fanny, when they were comfortably at rest,
"I can't help but get angry at the women as I walk about, for I
do see them do so much foolishness. Why, to-day I saw one

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page82" id="page82">[Pg 82]</a></span>

crazy for souvenirs, and I believe she thought everything was a
souvenir. I saw her pick up a nail and put it into her handbag,
and when she came up to the Pennsylvania coal monument in the
Mining building, she commenced putting pieces of the coal in her
pocket. Then one of the working men played really a mean joke
on her. He came up with a lump as big as a water bucket.
Then he asked her if she wouldn't like to have that to remember
the Fair by. And what do you think, she just said she thought
he was very kind, but she didn't believe she could take it, for it
was so big. But she would like awfully to have it. I saw the
man shut one eye and say to the other man that the woman was
crazy, because it was just the same kind of coal that she put into
the stove every day at home."</p>

<p>"Now the only thing I've got to grumble about," said Uncle,
"is what's models and what's facts. There is no use of scaring
people to death with things that ain't so. Now over in the Government
building I saw some hop plant lice that was not less than
a foot long; there was a potato bug nine inches long, and there
was a chinch bug two feet long, for I out with my rule and
measured it. When I seen them I said, the Lord help the people
who live where them things do, and then some city folks
laughed at me, when at last Fanny came along and said they was
models. Then we went into another room and there was soldiers
from everywhere and army things that made me believe I was
back again with Sherman, but there again they were wax, excepting
the wagons and guns. I went up to one of the officers when
I fust come in and I says, says I, "Are you regular army folks or
Illinois militia?" and he didn't answer, and I turned to one of
the privates and I asked why there was so many of them bunched together,
then I seed some folks a laughing at me and I slunk
away. I say the government is in poor business when it makes
sport of its own defenders."</p>

<p>"Over there in the Transportation building I seen what it said
was the boat Columbus sailed in; but after all, Fanny said it was
a model. Right close to it was the boat what Grace Darling
rowed out into the storming sea and saved so many lives. I
thought it was a model, but Fanny said it was the very boat she
used. I jest thought ef that was really the boat, we could all be
sure that Grace Darling didn't stand o' Sunday mornins afore the
glass a paintin' and a powderin'." He was getting himself
worked up to the belief that he was a very much abused old
soldier, when Fanny said:</p>

<p>"Grandpa, I have just cut a splendid piece of poetry out of

<h2><i>CHAPTER VIII</i></h2>

<h4>LA RABIDA</h4>

<p>It was a warm summer day, and rolling chairs, launches and
gondolas were in great demand. At Fanny's suggestion they
decided to take an electric launch and go around to La Rabida,
where the relics of Columbus were kept. She accosted one of
the guards who attends to the moorings by asking how near the
launch would take them to La Rabida.</p>

<p>"La-Ra-La what? I don't think I know what that is," said
the guide.</p>

<p>"La Rabida is the convent&mdash;the Columbus relics are there.
Columbus was the man who discovered America," Aunt volunteered
to tell him.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I have heard of Columbus, of course, but I haven't
been here very long."</p>

<p>"Well, the convent is over at the lake end of the Agricultural
building. Do the launches go there?"</p>

<p>"The Agricultural building? Let me see; that is over&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you know where the colonnade is?"</p>

<p>"No. I don't."</p>

<p>"Ever hear of the grand basin, the gold statue, the lagoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; this is the lagoon."</p>

<p>"Well, how long will it be before a launch will come along?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/image29.jpg" width="363" height="329" alt="image29" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"BEFORE THEM WAS THE STRANGE OLD CONVENT."</span>
</div>

<p>He went out to the edge of the landing and looked up the
lagoon. Then he jerked out, "in three-quarters of a minute."
He was provoked about something. It may have been because

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page88" id="page88">[Pg 88]</a></span>

she wanted to know so much; it may have been for a latent discovery
of a lack of knowledge on his part, or it may have been
because Fanny had been laughing at something; Fanny laughs
easily. She is just as likely to laugh where she ought to cry;
the electric guard didn't see anything to laugh at. They sat down
on a pile of lumber to wait the three-quarters of a minute. It
was three-quarters, and several more. The guard said the warm
weather had come unexpectedly. They would have the whole
fifty-two launches running soon. But only about half the number
had been necessary until now, and they were very busy and could
not keep up the time. One came soon after that. As they were
stepping in Fanny asked how much the round trips were. Some
one said "25 cents in the Director General's schedule, but in the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page89" id="page89">[Pg 89]</a></span>

launches they are 50 cents." The captain, or the man who takes
the money, heard him. He smiled, and charged them 25 cents
apiece to La Rabida. Just afterward a man handed him $1 and
said "Administration building&mdash;for two." The Administration
building is considerably this side of La Rabida. The captain
slipped the dollar into his pocket and passed on to the next. The
woman said:</p>

<p>"Did he keep the whole of it?"</p>

<p>"Keep it? I should think he did. You don't get much back
on these side experiences. I ought to have asked him how much
it costs to go all the way."</p>

<p>But the man made no reply. He was meditating. He evidently
had not read the morning papers. They gave all the prices&mdash;admissions
and extra convenience.</p>

<p>It was with feelings of considerable curiosity, mingled with
awe, that they approached La Rabida.</p>

<p>Before them was the strange old building which they knew was
the convent where Columbus had received such rest, comfort and
inspiration in his great enterprise that opened the door to modern
civilization.</p>

<p>A number of tents were on the south of the house, and soldiers
were to be seen standing about, with their heavy muskets, which
mean nothing but that their lives are pledged to protect this collection,
belonging to the Vatican and the descendants of Columbus.
All the royal letters patent from the sovereigns of Spain to
Columbus and many letters written by Columbus himself, are in
the cases. His will is also there. The signature of Columbus
is written in this way:</p>

<p>At one end of this room is the collection of pictures loaned
from the Vatican by Pope Leo. No one is allowed to go up the
steps. One of the Columbian guards standing there said, in
answer to one of Uncle's questions:</p>

<p>"This is the altar. It is sacred and no one is allowed up there,
because these pictures are very valuable and very small."</p>

<p>The mention of the size in that connection meant that they
could be carried off easily. But nothing could be carried off
easily with those watchful "regulars" about. A contract was
made by Spain with the United States before the collection left
there that it should be guarded by a detachment of United States
soldiers. That contract is fulfilled to the letter. No one is allowed
even to touch the glasses of the case.</p>

<p>There are some wonderful pictures on the wall of Musaico
Filato, which belong to Pope Leo. They are wonderfully beautiful
as pictures, without thought of the thousands of tiny mosaics
used in making the pictures, and that each one was placed in by
hand. Some of the other pictures are wonderful, too&mdash;wonderful
in their hideousness. No two artists seem to have the same
idea of the features of Columbus. There seemed to be but one
thing that they agreed upon fully, and that was that Columbus
wore his hair chopped off on his neck. There is a great likeness
there. Ferdinand and Isabella looked painfully disturbed on
being trotted out at this World's Fair, and just exactly as if they
never could have agreed on allowing Columbus or any one else
to discover us. Some of the pictures were not numbered, and
some of them had two numbers. The young lady who sold catalogues
said they would be all right after a while.</p>

<p>"Say, can you tell me&mdash;is these 'ere things all Columbus'
works&mdash;did 'e do 'em all?" asked Uncle.</p>

<p>"No, it is the history of his life."</p>

<p>"Didn't he do any of 'em?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page91" id="page91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>When the young lady shook her head, Uncle walked away,
disappointed. He knew just what it was to dig and toll down on
his farm, and he could <ins class="correction" title="original: guage">gauge</ins> greatness only by labor. And if
Columbus did not do any of it, paint any of the pictures, or build
the convent, he could not understand what had made them go to
so much expense to build the old convent when a good picture
for a few dollars would serve just as well.</p>

<p>After going through the narrow entrance of La Rabida they
found little dark rooms with pictures and maps and charts of Columbus
and Isabel in many different forms. In the southwest
room they found a table and doors and bricks and the key from
the house of Columbus. In the case among the many sacred
relics was a locket said to contain some of the dust of that great
man. They saw the Lotto portrait which was used on the souvenir
half dollars. There were the Indian idols which Columbus
brought to Isabel, one of the canoes in which the Indians came
out to meet him, and even one of the bolts to which Columbus
was chained. Each one of the party were continually discovering
the most wonderful things. Fanny found an autograph letter of
the great Cortez and she wrote in her note book from the book of
Waltzeemuller where he said, "Americus has discovered a fourth
part more of the world and Europe and Asia are named for women
this country ought to be called America or land of Americus because
he has an acute intellect."</p>

<p>While she was writing this an old gentleman came up to her
and said, "Say, Miss, I want to see the remains of Columbus, I
heard they are here with a soldier on each side of his body."</p>

<p>Fanny pointed to the place where the locket was but he was disappointed
and did not care to go "just to see a pinch of dust in a
locket."</p>

<p>Aunt was sitting on her camp stool in the room where the table
of Columbus was, but to get a nearer view of something she left

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page92" id="page92">[Pg 92]</a></span>

it for a moment. Just then a family of man and wife with five
children came in and found that they were standing at the table
and by the door of Columbus. The woman saw the chair and
supposing it to be a part of the Columbus furniture sat down in it.
Then she arose and called her husband. "Henry come here and
set in this chair. Thank God I've set where Columbus set."
The husband sat in it awhile and then each one of the children
time about, while Aunt Sarah waited patiently for them to get
through, not wanting to break the pleasure of their great achievement.</p>

<span class="caption">"THANK GOD I'VE SET WHERE COLUMBUS SET."</span>
</div>

<p>Tired of further sight seeing, our family decided to leave the
grounds, and started on their homeward journey with over two
hours ahead of them. There was no use walking through streets

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page93" id="page93">[Pg 93]</a></span>

when they could pass nearly the whole distance through buildings.
This was one of the ways to economize on travel and time.</p>

<p>Across the bridge from La Rabida was the great archway entrance
of the Agricultural hall. Around the old convent with its
low-browed walls ran a width of fresh dirt at intervals over which
were stuck the ancient signs, "Keep off the grass," but no grass
was yet visible.</p>

<p>"That's what I don't like about this White City. So much of
it is so, and so much of it ain't so that I never can tell what
is so," said Uncle.</p>

<p>In the Agricultural hall there were never ending wonders for
the farmer. All the agricultural ingenuity of the earth was
centered here.</p>

<p>"Now, come on, father, we can see plows and lawn mowers
when we get home."</p>

<p>But Uncle lingered longingly over a new device for lacerating
the soil and destroying its noxious productions. Uncle and Aunt
had ceased their usual exclamations after the first two or three
days. In the first place exclamations, such as the good deacon
would use, were entirely inadequate, and in the second place the
cords of utterance had become exhausted.</p>

<p>"Well, ef they haint gone and got some dog fennel here. I
wonder where the cuckle-burrs are, and the tick-seed, and the
jimson weeds and the puff-balls. It's a mean discrimination to
bring one of the nuisances without bringing them all."</p>

<p>They went through and out over the bridge of the south canal,
on past the bandstand to the Administration building.</p>

<p>"What inspiring music," said Fanny. "It is hard to tell
whether our eyes or our ears can bring us the most joy. Surely
I can live to be a better woman now every day of my life."</p>

<p>As they entered the Administration building they saw a man in
the center of the court looking up through the building at the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page94" id="page94">[Pg 94]</a></span>

great dome which seemed to pierce the sky. He leaned farther
and farther back until he fell backwards and lay there on his back
still gazing intently upward. A number of people rushed up to
him horror stricken, as if he had just fallen from the top of the
dome and they expected to see him a crushed mass. As they
began to close up around him he yelled out: "O you get away
you fool people, you don't know what a fine view I'm a getting
of the top."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 354px;">
<img src="images/image31.jpg" width="354" height="334" alt="image31" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"HIS HALF-DOLLAR ENTRANCE FEE GAVE HIM THE RIGHT TO SEE THE DOME FROM THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION."</span>
</div>

<p>But one of the Columbian guards seemed to think that was
not the legal way to view the dizzy heights of the building and
forthwith jerked him to his feet and ushered him to the outside.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page95" id="page95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

The last seen of the man he was muttering, "Them fool builders
put them picters clear up at the top and then the fool guards wont
let a fellow enjoy them."</p>

<p>He evidently believed he had been treated outrageously in a
free country by an autocratic guard, and that his fifty cents entrance
fee entitled him to view any object in any position of
vantage.</p>

<p>They went on into the Mines building where the sparkling ores
of a thousand mines were in piles and pyramids or wrought into
colonnades, facades and burnished domes. There were dazzling
diamonds and beautiful opals, emeralds and gems from all parts
of the earth; Michigan's copper globe, North Carolina's pavilion
of mica designs, Montana's famous Rehan statue of solid silver
resting on a plinth of gold, Arizona's old Spanish arastra and New
Mexico's mining cabin.</p>

<p>From a northwest doorway they passed on out of this world of
subterranean wonders across the street into the Transportation
building.</p>

<p>"I don't believe these things are used anywhere," said
Johnny. "They're like the four-legged woman&mdash;just made for
show. Father, you can't expect me to ride in no common farm
wagon after bringin' me to see this."</p>

<p>"These cars do represent awful improvement in three generations,"
said Uncle. "Now, it is supposed that when I was a boy
I rode in that 'Flyer' there, or on the one they call 'Rocket;' but
I didn't, 'cause I never seed a train till I was past twenty. Fanny
would be supposed to ride up there in that gay three-story palace
on wheels, and Johnny will get to ride a hundred and fifty miles
an hour on that 'lectric railroad; but a common cattle car is fast
enough for me. I don't know what the world's a comin' to when
people rides a hundred and fifty miles an hour and choose to
sleep fourteen stories high."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page96" id="page96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>They had wandered around the locomotive section, and on
their way curiously viewed the famous "John Bull," the oldest
locomotive in America. Near by some workingmen throwing a
pile of dirt into a cart, caught Uncle's eye.</p>

<p>"Well, look at them fellers. Ef my farm hands was to work
that way I'd not get enough corn to feed my Jerseys a month."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">

<span class="caption">"A FIGHT, A FIGHT!"</span>
</div>

<p>He was quite disgusted with their slow and listless movements.
They returned down another aisle and came out in
front of the magnificent doorway of the building. They were
just behind two elegantly dressed ladies, who were looking up at
the decorations.</p>

<p>"Well, upon me wohd, do obswerve that dohway. How

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page97" id="page97">[Pg 97]</a></span>

intwesting. I am shuah it seems to me to be pewfectly supub.
It is so lovie, so sreet."</p>

<p>"O Grandpa," said Johnny, "do tell me what language they
are talking."</p>

<p>"I don't know, Johnny; ask Fanny."</p>

<p>John's attention was here caught by the loud arguments of
some gondoliers at the landing near by, and he ran down to see
the fight he was sanguine enough to believe was about to take
place.</p>

<p>They made noise enough to be sure but perhaps this was their
way of attracting attention. There were at least a dozen excited
foreigners gesticulating over some exciting topic. Evidently some
foreigner had been riding and he thought the fare was too high.
Noise and genteel swearing were the chief argument.</p>

<table cellpadding="5" summary="note">

</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p>But the storm ceased as quickly as it had begun and in a minute
they were all as complacent and jolly as children.</p>

<p>Fanny read aloud to her grandfather the words over the archway:</p>

<p>"There be three things which make a nation great and prosperous:
a fertile soil, busy workshops, and easy conveyance for
men and goods from place to place."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page98" id="page98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Grandpa, Bacon wrote that and he lived in the time of
Shakespeare, when Elizabeth was Queen of England."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, child, it's a great prophesy of our greatness. I
thought before I came here that the soil done about all of it and
what little was not done by the soil was done by the workshop but
I see that there is just as much necessity and greatness outside of
these things."</p>

<p>"Grandpa, let me read what is on the right side of the doorway:
"Of all inventions, the alphabet and the printing press alone excepted,
those inventions which abridge distance have done most
for civilization." That was Macaulay, the great essayist and
historian of England. I wish I had known he said that, for last
month we debated in our literary society the question: "Resolved.
That bullets have done more for the spread of civilization than
<ins class="correction" title="original: second closing quote missing">books.""</ins></p>

<p>It is rather an amusing thing to note how the exposition affects
different people. Some of the visitors are of a type which nothing
moves. They have lived all their lives in the pursuit of a
placid routine of simple duties, and, while they have come to the
fair from a sense of duty and fully intend to see all that may be
seen, still they are prone to retire on occasion to some quiet corner
where they can rest unobserved, and then their talk invariably
drops into some simple, natural channel that is in accord with the
tenor of their dally lives. Of course this is tinctured more or less
with the unaccustomed sights and sounds about them, but not
greatly so; for the most part they simply ignore their surroundings.</p>

<p>In strong contrast are the ones who have obviously got themselves
up expressly for the fair regardless of expense; their clothes
are new, and are chiefly noticeable for the quality which Stevenson
refers to as "a kind of mercantile brilliancy." They are
nearly as much occupied in allowing others the inestimable

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page99" id="page99">[Pg 99]</a></span>

pleasure of gazing at them as they are in improving their own
minds. They are visitors, pure and simple, and they are characterized
by such an air of newness that even the flies avoid them
for fear of sticking to the varnish.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 167px;">
<img src="images/image33.jpg" width="167" height="287" alt="image33" title="Illustration" />
</div>

<p>There is the girl with the notebook, a schoolmarm presumably,
though heaven only knows, she may be a lecturer. She usually
numbers glasses and a dark velvet
bag among her accoutrements.</p>

<p>She is possessed of all of the catalogues
and guide books sold on the
grounds, and in the bag is a further
supply of heavier literature for the
improvement of her idle moments.
It would puzzle anybody to find out
when these idle moments occur, for
when visible she is engaged in a frantic
rush from place to place, pausing
only for a moment to ask a question
or jot down an impression, sometimes
doing both at once without even looking
at the dispenser of information.</p>

<p>She must have a miscellaneous
mind, this girl, for anything seems to go with her from pig iron
to poetry. One of her stopped for an instant in the Electricity
building to inquire the name of a queer, compact, powerful
looking machine. The impression which she received from the
laconic attendant in charge went into her notebook in this form:</p>

<p style="font-size: smaller; padding-left: 3em">Multiple intensifier is round and black; looks
powerful; attendant says 360 horse power. Mem.,
look up multiple intensifiers in Century dictionary
on return, and find how they are applied to horses.</p>

<p>The machine in question was a dynamo, but perhaps she will
never know.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page100" id="page100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Japanese section of the Manufactures building two dear
little old women sat down to rest their tired feet in the midst of a
bewildering display of pottery, whose brilliant tints contrasted
strongly with the rusty crape and bombazine in which they were
dressed.</p>

<p>"I don't see," said one of them, "the use of sending missionaries
to Japan. I suppose they do worship all them things, but,
even if they do, I think that if they had as much pretty china to
home as they've got here, I'd be inclined to worship it myself. I
just don't see how they can help doing it. Do you?"</p>

<p>"No, I <ins class="original" title="original: comma missing">don't,</ins>" said the other. "It seems almost what you
could expect. I don't believe they are so very bad after all. I
can't believe that anyone who could make such lovely things
could be a very wicked heathen. I should think the Japanese
would almost feel like sending missionaries over here."</p>

<p>But Fanny was of a different type, she realized the sublime display
of mind and she grew months in the excellence of womanhood
every hour of her enthronement in the soul of this great
panorama of intellect and labor. Aunt was silently seeing everything
like the great dream that it was but Uncle was storing his
mind with facts whereby he could confound his neighbors.</p>

<p>"It really seems strange to me," said Fanny, "to see how
some of these people take the Fair for a circus. If the band
played all the time they would never get a chance to look inside
the buildings. The moment they get within earshot of the tuba
horns they anchor themselves to benches or camp-stools and
watch the leader swish the air with his baton. After the music
stops they will begin hunting for more excitement, and may finally
wander in among the pictures and admire some battle scene covering
a whole wall. To-day I saw a young man and his girl
standing before that wonderful statuary from the Trocadero palace
looking the goddess in the eye while both were eating peanuts.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page101" id="page101">[Pg 101]</a></span>

They are after nothing but a good time, as at a country
fair. I believe it is all because they don't understand what they
are looking at. Grandpa, I can finish my education now and know
how to bless you for your goodness to me. I am just beginning
to see what a great privilege it is to live."</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER IX</i></h2>

<h4>THE PLAISANCE PROPHECY</h4>

<p>Fanny had made the acquaintance of one of the ladies in
charge of the educational exhibit of one of the states, and who
occupied rooms on the grounds. This lady made arrangements
for Fanny to remain over night with her and view a sunrise on the
lake and over the "White City." It was to be an experience
well in keeping with her emotional nature.</p>

<p>The morning came, and the two placed themselves where
they could see through the columns of the peristyle across the
lake in the direction of the sun. They were sitting on their camp
stools on the bridge east of the statue in the basin with their
cloaks drawn tightly around them, waiting in awe as they saw the
suffusions of color spread upward into the grey sky.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is a flash of fire far out on the lake. The last
pink curtain of mist rolled slowly away light and fleecy as cotton
wool, and the sun, behind this lazy apparel of his rising, spreads
a crimson glow over the sky and lake. Miles it comes across
the rippling waves, stealing through each arch and pillared opening
of the peristyle, creeping over the motionless waters of the
basin and bringing brightness everywhere.</p>

<p>Slowly the great ball of fire rises higher. Now it flashes upon
the statue of liberty, now on Diana, aiming her arrow down into
the laughing waters. Under its rays the winged angels on the
spires of the palace of mechanic arts seem to start into life, as
if they had but paused for an instant in their flight toward the
land of dawning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page103" id="page103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Now the statues of the seasons, flanking the four corners of the
Agricultural building, greet the day. Columbus, his face ever toward
the west, rides onward with the sun in his triumphal car. He
looks down on the work wrought out to his glory and honor, but
his journey is westward still, out of the sunlight into the gloom.
Against the dark western sky hangs the majestic dome of the
Administration building, now a blaze of ivory and gold.</p>

<p>The sun lifts slowly out of the water. Its rays shine white and
clear. The tired guards lean wearily over the parapets of the
canals, throwing bread to hungry swans. Flocks of seabirds
sweep up and down the canals like the first flurries of autumn
snow. The water fowl greet the day with joyous clamor, adding
a quaint, rural touch, almost startling in this city of silent palaces.
They splash about the wooded island, screaming lustily when boys
come in skiffs to steal their eggs. Swallows and frowsy little
sparrows flit from their nests, built in the very hands of the golden
goddess of Liberty.</p>

<p>From the roofs of every building there is a sudden flash of
color. A thousand flags float in the morning breeze. Ten thousand
workmen hurry through the sunny park.</p>

<p>The mystical city of dreamland is again the workshop of the
world.</p>

<p>Three hours later our family were together in the art gallery
glancing at the famous paintings and statues which the nations
had given to show what subtle art can achieve on canvas and
stone.</p>

<p>Aunt said she always knew those French people were the
most shocking people in the world. How different their section
of paintings from those of the United States. Fanny had no
time for any thought outside of the overwhelming beauty of all she
saw. She had begun to paint a little and to do some molding,
and she knew how to appreciate the marvelous skill before her.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page104" id="page104">[Pg 104]</a></span>

She saw very few people who saw anything in them but a show.
Uncle was positively disgusted, and went through only as if it was
his duty to see everything. But among the statuary he found
some things of more interest.</p>

<p>"Why, Grandpa, how solemn you look. Now, I can't feel
solemn at this piece of statuary. Let's see what is its name.
Here it is&mdash;'The Struggle for Bread.' That makes it more interesting.
The people are starving and the factories can give
work only to a few. Every day they throw out tickets from the
windows, and whoever brings a ticket to the office window is
employed. Look at that strong young man. He has secured
one and the old man is pleading for it, and the woman with her
little child has been knocked down in the struggle of the people
for the ticket."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, child, you can appreciate only the romance and
sentiment of it. You have never struggled in despair for bread,
and may God keep you! but Sarah and me have seen many sad,
weary days of struggles to live."</p>

<p>Johnny had little care for the sentiment or the romance. He
was much amused, but it was a dull place for him. At last a
thought struck him. He struggled with it several minutes in a
very deep study before he ventured to reveal his perplexity. At
last it became too great to be borne longer.</p>

<p>"Say, Grandpa, I kin see why the sculpture can't sculpture
clothes on their folks; but I don't see why the painters can't
paint their folks up some more decent."</p>

<p>That same thing puzzled Uncle, and he could not answer. He
thought a great deal, but he only muttered something about
pictures not fit to be stuck on his horse-lot gate posts.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven o'clock when Fanny and Aunt found
Uncle and Johnny sitting disconsolately on the steps of the south
entrance awaiting their appearance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page105" id="page105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>John was patriotic and he wanted to see the liberty bell over in
the Pennsylvania building. A great crowd was gathering as they
came up and Johnny found out that the interest came from the
fact that the Duke of Varagua, the representative of Spain at the
Fair and the descended of Columbus, was visiting the bell. It
was a sight to awaken memory for the representative of the
fifteenth century discovery to be paying respects to the representative
of nineteenth century liberty.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/image34.jpg" width="364" height="340" alt="image34" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"NOT FIT TO STICK ON OUR HORSE-LOT GATE POST."</span>
</div>

<p>City folks were not there alone. Many country people were enjoying
the pulses of freedom, liberty and patriotism. An honest
looking plow boy standing near Fanny asked his father what he
thought of the "Dook," a real live "Dook."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page106" id="page106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think the dook ort to be proud of hevin' been kin to Columbus,
but I'll be blamed ef I don't think Columbus would be proud
too, if he wuz yer, and could tech hands 'ith his forty-eleventh
grandson. It takes a purty good man to stand all the honors
levished 'pon him that the dook's a-gittin' 'ithout his head a-bein'
turned, an' I jes' say good fur the dook."</p>

<p>"It's all right to hev smart kin folks afore you, but it takes lots
o' hustlin' in these days an' lots o' hard work in order to stand
fust; an I vote the dook is a fine represen'tive o' his Columbus
grandfather. Now lets git closer to the old lib'ty bell."</p>

<p>As the rural philosopher looked upon the bell hanging there in
the Pennsylvania State building he said, unconscious of the crowd
around him:</p>

<p>"When thet bell kep' a ringin' out lib'ty, the folks thet wuz
they didn't know thet in a little mor'n a hundred years the hull
world would be a bowin' to thet bell; an' they never hed no idee
it would be carried away out yere in a place called Chicago, covered
over 'ith flowers an' gyarded by perlice to keep folks from
a techin' it, a fearin' harm might cume to it&mdash;an' it a standin' as
a symbol o' great faith an' courage. I'm powerful glad I kin
stand yere to-day with my fam'ly and look at thet bell. I jes'
wisht they'd let it ring onct."</p>

<p>But there were others too ignorant or stupid to be patriotic before
such a scene.</p>

<p>John became indignant, almost to the fighting point, at the
amazing stupidity of some of the remarks concerning the bell. To
him it was more than an emblem, it was a hero.</p>

<p>He heard comments which are past belief. Of course, there
are patriots who approach with reverence and understanding and
who are only restrained by the police from chipping off pieces of
the bell, but many enter and gaze and depart in bland ignorance.</p>

<p>"By jinks! but that's an old feller," exclaimed one inspired

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page107" id="page107">[Pg 107]</a></span>

ignoramus. "Wonder where it came from." Another, a stout,
prosperous, business-looking party, observed that it was cracked.
"Reckon that was done bringing it here," he said. "The railroads
are fearful careless about handling freight."</p>

<p>Still another intelligent communicator, and it seemed as if
nothing short of positive inspiration could justify his views, spoke
of the bell slightingly as a poor exhibit, and wondered what the
Pittsburg foundries meant by sending such stuff to an international
exhibition.</p>

<p>It was now noon lunch time, and our happy family went over
to a table in one of the cafes. At one o'clock Uncle and Aunt
were to occupy rolling chairs in spending the afternoon sight-seeing
around Midway Plaisance. They had heard a great deal
about the sights there, and concluded it best to see the outside
first and prepare a campaign of sight-seeing based on information
received from the chair pushers.</p>

<p>Across the table from them sat a man eating his meal in a
fatigued sort of way that caught their attention.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Colonel," said a gentleman, coming up to him.
The colonel was not himself, that was plain. His eyes looked
dreamy, and he had the appearance of a man who was under the
influence of some strong and very pleasurable excitement. When
the friend saluted him he did not reply with marked courtesy.
He did not even look at him. He continued to gaze unmeaningly
at his plate, and to murmur "Irene-te-raddle, fol de-rol.
I'll niver go there anny more."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" asked the gentleman, testily.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it do beat the dickens," said the colonel, irreverently,
"I've lived a long toime an' seen manny a queer soight in
circuses an' dime musooms an' hanky-panky shows, but niver
till to-day&mdash;oh! Naha-a, it's a bright eyes an'&mdash;a bonny locks&mdash;"
here the colonel began to thrum the table.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page108" id="page108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>The friend came over impatiently and shook his fist under
the colonel's nose.</p>

<p>"You weak-minded old gazabo, is it to hear ye singin' topical
songs thot Oi came down from Archery road? What ails ye?"</p>

<p>The colonel remarked easily: "Don't git gay, George; don't
git gay. Because Oi chuse to sing a little is no reason why ye
should take liberties." Then he went on, half-musing: "Oi
don't give annything for the Fair itsilf. O'Connor tuk me in
there first, but what do Oi ca-are for show cases full uv dhried
prunes, ould r-rocks an' silk handkerchers? I was f'r goin' over
to see Buffalo Willie shootin' Injuns an' rescuin' Annie Oakley
frum the red divvels, but O'Connor sez: 'No,' he sez, 'come on
an' see the Midway,' he sez. 'So over we goes to the Midway,
an', George, Oi haven't been well since. There'll be a trolley in
me hed to me dhyin' dhay, there will, there will. We had no
more than got in the strate when a nigger in a mother Hubbard
comes up an' sez: 'Little mon.'</p>

<p>"'Yis,' sez I, 'an' dom ye little mon till ye do go home an'
put on ye're pants, ye bould thing.'</p>

<p>"'Hugh-h!' sez O'Connor; 'that's a Turk.'</p>

<p>"'Thin there's a pair of us,' I sez; 'let's go.'</p>

<p>"'Well,' he sez, 'come into the Turkish village.'</p>

<p>"'An' see more niggers? I'll not,' I sez.</p>

<p>"'Will you go to the Irish village, thin?'</p>

<p>"'No,' I sez, 'aint I seen you?'</p>

<p>"'Well, where will you go?'</p>

<p>"'If you know a place where they keep beer,' I sez, 'I'm convenient.'</p>

<p>"He shoots me into a hole in the ground. George, ye should
a seen it! At one table sat a lot of black fellows with red towels
around their heads an' knives stickin' out of their yellow cloaks.
At another table was half-a-dozen gurrls with earrings as big as

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page111" id="page111">[Pg 111]</a></span>

barrelhoops in their ears.</p>

<p>"'Come on back,' sez O'Connor.</p>

<p>"'No,' I sez, 'this is good enough for a poor man,' an' we sat
down at the next table to th' gurrls. Well, sir, from that time
my mind's a blank. I was like the feller in the story-books. I
knew no more. I dunno what happened at all, at all, with dancin'
gurrls an' snake cha-armers an' Boolgarian club swingers an'
foreign men goin' around with their legs in mattesses. All I
know is this, that I was carried to a ca-ar in a seedin' chair by
two men with room enough in the seat of their pants to dhrive a
street sweeper. Did y'r never ride in a seedin' chair, George?
Then, faith, ye're not in my class. Fol-der-rol, de-rol de raddle,
fol&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' what did ye do with O'Connor?"</p>

<p>"How do I know? The last time I remimber him he was
askin' a girl in the Turkish theayter whether she liked vanilla or
rawsburry in her soda wather, the droolin jackanapes. Ah, na-ha,
the girls of Limerick city&mdash;&mdash;." The colonel resumed his
thrumming.</p>

<p>"And is that all you see of the fair."</p>

<p>"Yis," said the colonel, "an" faith! if you had me hed you'd
think it was enough. An', George, to be in earnest wid ye, that
I've known since you was a little dirty boy, go to the fair, ride
around in the boats, luk at the canned tomatties an' the table-clothes,
ride in the electric cars, but beware of that Midway.
It'll no do for young men at all, at all. You'd lose your head.
You would, you would. Oh, fol-de-rol, de raddle rol."</p>

<p>After this amusing experience just related before them, Uncle
thought it very advisable to give Johnny "a good talkin' to about
doin' nothin' wrong in that heathen exhibition of furriners."</p>

<p>But Johnny could afford to finish that Saturday walking demurely

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page112" id="page112">[Pg 112]</a></span>

around with the rest, for the next Monday morning Louis,
the train-boy, was to be guard and guide through the mysteries of
Midway Plaisance.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER X</i></h2>

<h4>PLAISANCE SOCIETY</h4>

<p>When Monday morning came the family were promptly at the
60th street gate at nine o'clock. Johnny espied Louis with his eye
over a knot hole that seemed designed by providence to let the
hungry outsiders have a morsel of the Midway Plaisance scenery.
Inside of the grounds Johnny determinedly led the way at once to
the great Ferris go-round. They stood before it measuring their
chances of living through such a revolution. It did not take much
to persuade Fanny to accompany the venturesome boys; Uncle
positively refused to discuss such a piece of folly, but Aunt decided
at last that if Fanny went she must go also.</p>

<p>Like a forbidden specter the skeleton of the Ferris Wheel
stands out gaunt and fleshless. All around is full of light and
gayety.</p>

<p>A devout Moslem may be pardoned if, as he passes, he touches
his forehead with three fingers of his right hand and murmurs:
"Allah il Allah!" Some such exorcism seems to be needed to
ward off the evil spirits that one would think must cluster around
the ponderous structure, perching, perhaps, like the broomstick
riders of Salem, on its spare metal ribs.</p>

<p>They entered the car of the great wheel, and when the signal
to start was given they found that another old lady with her dudish
son were to be their companions in the aerial <ins class="correction" title="original: full stop missing">flight.</ins></p>

<p>The earth was dropping away. Higher and higher they
went. Johnny was holding with a death-like grip on to the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page114" id="page114">[Pg 114]</a></span>

car. Fanny's whole life was passing before her like a procession
of spectres. In a few minutes they had gone more than one
hundred and fifty feet, and the sky seemed to be falling upon
them.</p>

<p>"Stop her!" shouted the dude, accompanying his words with
a frantic waving of his hands. Higher yet they ascended and
his face assumed the look depicted in the features of Dante's
characters when about to enter the infernal regions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/image36.jpg" width="356" height="305" alt="image36" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"HIS PLANS IN LIFE WERE INTERFERED WITH."</span>
</div>

<p>"Now, if the good Lord ever permits me to get back to the
earth safely," said the old woman, "I promise never to leave it
again till I am called to die."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page115" id="page115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>They had reached the top and passed the crisis of going up.
Now they began to fall. The sky was leaving them, and the
earth was coming after them. They had no time to think. The
coming down was worse than the going up. When they stepped
out on the earth at the bottom of their descent it was with a sensation
of thankfulness never experienced before.</p>

<p>The wheel is 275 feet high, and requires over 500 horse power
to turn it. The axle is the largest piece of steel ever forged, and
it was a great triumph of engineering skill to put it in place 150
feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Hagenbeck's animal show was naturally the next attraction.
Some distance ahead of them there was quite a commotion.
Johnny and his companion were, as usual, ahead. In another
minute Johnny came running back to Fanny and caught her
by the hand. Without a word he started forward with her at a
rapid pace. Quite a crowd was following some strange object,
and Johnny hurried Fanny around to the front, where she saw
Mr. Hagenbeck coming leisurely toward them with a lion walking
by his side. This was the object which was attracting such a
large crowd of people, and it indeed took some courage to stand
there as he came by. So completely did they all acknowledge
the superiority of the animal that there was no jostling about him.
The Columbian guards did not have to form a line&mdash;in fact,
even they gave way to the distinguished walker who held his head
high in the air and enjoyed the bright sunshine without deigning
to look at the crowd of different races around him. He was a
native of India, and was born to be a king, but his plans in life
were interfered with, and the forest in which he was to have ruled
was invaded and he was captured. For some time he had not
been feeling well, and the proprietor determined to let the captive
see the sunshine. So they started out together, the lion walking
along as quietly as a spaniel. When the six lions in the cage

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page116" id="page116">[Pg 116]</a></span>

saw their comrade out for a stroll they gave a chorus of roars
which made the windows rattle. It was answered from the
roadway, and six guards who stood by thought discretion the
better part of valor, and started on a run for the viaduct. Mr.
Hagenbeck called them back and told them it was all right, but
they still kept a safe distance. The lion seemed to enjoy the
outing, yet when his trainer started to come back the monarch
of the jungle followed him.</p>

<p>The crowd parted as the pair came toward it with more haste
than grace, and the lion licked his companion's hand and went
back to his cage. Mr. Hagenbeck explained that the lion is one
of the largest in the world, and is not yet full grown. It is perfectly
gentle, and at his home in Hamburg it is not kept in a
cage, but plays in the yard with his children like a cat.</p>

<p>In front of Hagenbeck's building there were assembled a
motley crowd of people gazing into a small room over the entrance
way. There were a number of lions jumping about at the crack
of the master's whip and giving the people a sample show of
what could be seen inside. It caught the crowd, for there was a
rush to the ticket office when the keeper disappeared from among
the lions.</p>

<p>In the center of the building was a circular cage that looked
like an old fashioned wire rat trap greatly enlarged. Into this
cage the animals were introduced to go through with their <ins class="correction" title="original: full stop missing">performance.</ins></p>

<p>"Well for that bear to walk on that globe and roll it along beats
anything I ever seed," said Uncle. "He's got more agility in him
than I ever had even at my best. Johnny, you couldn't walk a log
across the creek as well as that bear walks that pole, and just look
at him walking backwards. If you will notice, Johnny, you will see
that the trainer gives all that acts bad a lump of sugar and the
ones that act good don't get nothing. That's the way of lots of

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page117" id="page117">[Pg 117]</a></span>

things, but if you will notice it the good ones will live the longest."</p>

<p>Aunt admired the dogs very much and observed that they
didn't have to be told what to do as the others did and they were
more willing and more grateful for attention. It was really
pathetic and comical to see how they seemed to appreciate applause.</p>

<p>The dwarf elephant, thirty-five inches high, was brought into
the arena in an ordinary trunk. It complacently ate some sugar
and returned to its quarters.</p>

<p>When the show was over they walked up the street toward the
Turkish village. Here a number of people were gathering around
a Turkish fakir who was at the side of the street loudly proclaiming
the merits of his wares and shouting out some tirade that his
employer had taught him as a means of attracting a crowd.
Johnny had seen the fellow before and he drew his friends up
close to him so they could hear his peculiar harangue.</p>

<p>"By the beard of the prophet, my heart swells to spill the souls
of those christian dogs. I am the mighty man of the desert and
they shall repent or die."</p>

<p>"He, he, he," yelled Louis, "that's the feller what the kids told
me yanked the mummy of Rameses from the holy temple and
knocks out all the Chinamen and Arabs along the Plaisance.
Look at him howl."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jeremiah, let's get away quick. I'm 'fraid he's dangerous,"
said Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>"No he ain't," said Louis. "Jest watch me," and he walked
up and tossed a copper at the orator's head and Abdul, the
mighty man of the desert, caught it with a grin and in broken English
said "tank ye."</p>

<p>"Disturb me not, O reckless heathens," and he flipped a pebble
with his fingers at a passing German who had just come out of
the mediaeval castle with a tray of beer mugs on his head. The

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page118" id="page118">[Pg 118]</a></span>

stone struck him on the ear. He set his tray down on a table
and came over to the warlike Arab.</p>

<p>"Wot ver you trow dot stein."</p>

<p>"Move on I contend only with the strong and mighty."</p>

<p>"Wot ver you trow dot stein," and the little waiter edged up
close.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 166px;">
<img src="images/image37.jpg" width="166" height="282" alt="image37" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"IT STRUCK HIM ON THE EAR.</span>
</div>

<p>"O mamma, I know the poor waiter will be killed, let's run
away quick," said Fanny.</p>

<p>"O yer don't know nothin'," said Johnny, disgusted. "The
Dutchman kin lick him in a minnit."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page119" id="page119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 342px;">

<span class="caption">"She sketched their heads&mdash;&mdash;"</span>
</div>

<p>"Wut ver you trow dot stein. You tink I am a house side.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page121" id="page121">[Pg 121]</a></span>

Donnervetter! I gif you some brains alretty;" and before Abdul,
son of Cairo, could think, the little German tripped him to the
ground, and as he fell caught him by the hair and dragged him
into the boundary lines of the Turkish village, slammed him on
the ground, and in a few minutes was back among the beer
tables of the castle with his tray, calling "peer, peer, shents! ah
trei peer, two cigar, kevarter tollar!"</p>

<p>The day had been a very fatiguing one, and Uncle and Aunt
decided to spend the next day quietly at home in the hotel.
Johnny and Louis had stayed manfully by the old folks all day,
and their promised adventures had not yet occurred. The next
day they were to be the guardians of Fanny, and they were quite
proud of the duty.</p>

<p>Fanny's note book and sketch book were now pretty well filled.
Midway Plaisance heads and feet offered the most tempting work
for her pencil. It is tempting enough for anyone to ask: "Where
did you get that hat?" or "Where did you hit that shoe?"
Evidently not in Chicago. Nothing of their kind ever graced a
western city in such versatile varieties until the bands began to
play and the world's cake-walk moved down the Plaisance.</p>

<p>In former years, when they had band concerts and Sunday
school picnics at Jackson Park the visitor saw about four kinds of
masculine <ins class="correction" title="original: headware">headwear</ins>. One was the gray helmet of the park
policeman resting under the tree. Another was the tall and shining
silk hat of the elderly parent. In addition to these were some
straw hats with rims not so wide as those of 1893, and derbys
which were a trifle higher in the crown than the new ones. In
the general description at the park the old styles of headwear
have been crowded to the background by foreign novelties. The
dicer, the fez, the turban, the hood, the helmet and the sun-shade
are becoming very common. Only the stranger who comes into
the gates is startled by the sight of a gaunt black man wrapped

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page122" id="page122">[Pg 122]</a></span>

in a sheet and wearing coiled around his head enough clothing
to make a good wash. But of all the incomprehensible varieties
of headwear about the grounds from foreign lands, it remained
for our own American Indian to outdo them all. When the great
No Neck, of the Sioux nation, walks through the grounds with his
war bonnet of eagle feathers trailing on the ground, the East
Indians concede their defeat. No Neck's bonnet is worth about
$400.</p>

<p>The footwear is worse in variety, if such a thing is possible.
Perhaps, after all, it is a matter of education rather than appearance
or convenience. The most elaborate is the high-topped
boots of the German cavalryman, and the least the Dahomey
Amazon, who sometimes has a red string tied around her great
toe. They come from a torrid country, and have been freezing
nearly every day, but scorn the apparel of the weak white man.
The Amazons refuse to wear shoes. When it is too chilly for
them to gallop around inside the bark fence they crawl into
their tents, roll themselves up in the black blankets and criticise
the policy of the Exposition.</p>

<p>On a moist day, when a Chinaman walks down the Plaisance
he leaves a trail of oval-shaped tracks. It would take a keen
judge of human nature to decide by looking at the tracks whether
he has left home or was going back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page123" id="page123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 341px;">
<img src="images/image39.jpg" width="341" height="579" alt="image39" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"&mdash;&mdash;And then their feet."</span>
</div>

<p>The Soudanese slipper is the most shiftless thing that a man
ever put on his foot. It is simply a leather sole and toe. These
represent the triumph of laziness. The Soudan citizen simply
walks into his slipper in the morning and then in the evening he
backs out. Every time he takes a step he lifts his heel away
from the sole and it seems morally certain that he will lose the
slipper, but in some way he manages to hold it. It is said this
trick is accomplished by elevating the big toe at each step, thus
preventing any slip. Any uncultured American who started for a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page125" id="page125">[Pg 125]</a></span>

promenade, wearing such things, would be in his stocking feet before
he proceeded ten steps, but the men in the Cairo street tramp
around all day and apparently do not realize that they are running
any risk.</p>

<p>That evening at home Fanny gave a review of her note book,
wherein she had recorded her observations on the politeness of
the different nations as she had witnessed them. She thought
the Javanese were the politest people of all. They always lay
their hands upon their hearts and say, "I am honored," when
spoken to. When they failed in their ability to answer a question,
they just smile to show their good will. The Fort Rupert Indians
politely tell their visitor to go when they have told what is
asked for. There is of course more kinds of etiquette in the
Plaisance than in any other spot of its size on earth. If the visitor
desired to be just right it would require an etiquette reference
book in at least sixteen languages.</p>

<p>Among the Turks there are strange habits. In greeting a
stranger they bow very low and remain perfectly silent until spoken
to. They will then shake hands in a genuine English fashion.
One Turk calling on another will never sit down until the host
arrives, even if he has to wait an hour. When the host comes in
the two sit down after having exchanged greetings and not another
word is spoken until coffee is served. The Syrians, on the other
hand, will not turn their faces to a host before being spoken to.
It is the proper thing when visiting one of them to take a seat
with the back to the door and wait until the host enters and make
no move until spoken to, when the visitor is expected to rise and
bow.</p>

<p>To fully understand all an Egyptian says and does is a harder
task than deciphering the hieroglyphics on an obelisk. The language
of the Egyptian gentleman is the most fulsome possible.
If he should be in need of a little temporary loan he will pound

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page126" id="page126">[Pg 126]</a></span>

the man (whom he hopes to confidence successfully) on the back
until he can hardly breathe. Experts in Egyptian etiquette can
tell by the pounding process what is coming, and when the ceremony
reaches the piledriver degree it is the proper thing to say:
"What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>On hearing this the Egyptian will talk something like this:
"Do for me? Why, my dear and most honored sir, your humble
dog of a servant would not presume to ask a favor of one so great
as you. I thought of calling on you yesterday, but it rained, and
I feared that you would not be in a good humor and might refuse
me, but then I want nothing. Who am I that a humble follower
of Mohammed should dare to ask of you, my great lord and
master, the very slightest favor? And yet if it had not rained
yesterday I should have been fully inclined to ask you for temporary
aid, but to-day I would not think of causing your highness
any trouble. Why should I, who am so lowly, ask one for $5 for
a few days. It would be an insult to you; one you could never
forget. What, you insist on it? I am to take this, am I? Now
really, as I was saying that one so low&mdash;but if you positively
insist, if you are sure you will be deeply and terribly insulted if I
do not take it&mdash;but your dog of a servant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>That settles it. Having obtained the money he marches out
without a thank you or goodbye.</p>

<p>The Dahomey people are the strangest of all. The first greeting
of one amazon to the other is to slap her face. The visitor
always slaps the hostess first, and if the visit is welcome the
visitor gets a cuff on each cheek, and if it is not convenient to
receive the visitor no slap is given in return.</p>

<p>But the palm is left to the American for a whole-souled disregard
of the feelings of others. The show was brought here for
the special benefit of the visitor; he has paid his money, and he
has the right to do as he pleases.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page127" id="page127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>If the sedan chair bearers happen to pass with some fat man
for a passenger, the whole street is in an uproar of English comment
meant to be humorous. Then the ordinary American visitor
seems to think it his prerogative to point at the foreign contingent
and say things aloud about them that would secure physical
retaliation if the object of the remark were a citizen of the
United States instead of a guest of the nation.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XI</i></h2>

<h4>A STARTLING MYSTERY</h4>

<p>The next day was what the boys called African day; that is, they
intended to see all that was to be seen from Dahomey to Nubia
and Soudan. Fanny was to spend the morning in the panoramas
of the Burnese Alps and the volcano Kilaueau. At noon she
would meet them at one of the inns.</p>

<p>The boys wandered about for some time in search of adventure.
Over in the street of Cairo there were two peculiar structures that
looked like inverted soup-bowls. There was a three cornered
aperture In the front of each where men and women could be seen
crawling in and out. Over one of these doors was a placard on
which was painted, "See the 18 months old Soudanese baby dance.
The only dance of the kind on earth." Over the door of the
other one was a placard on which was printed "Only 25c to see
the great Nubian terpsichorean evolutions." Two or three men
would come up, stand awhile and listen at the curious sounds from
within, resembling very much the noise made by a pack of curs
after a rabbit they did not hope to catch; or, perhaps, more like a
plantation jamboree when all the strings of the banjo were broken
but one and it had been mended twice.</p>

<p>The people came to see the sights, and here was a mysterious
something they might regret a lifetime in the missing. Our two
boys required no mental balancing of any nice points of propriety.
It was there to see, and they had the money to see it
with. What more was wanting? Nothing but to exchange the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page129" id="page129">[Pg 129]</a></span>

fee for the yellow ticket and present it to the saffron-hued keeper
of the door. The little half space alloted to visitors inside was
crowded, but the two boys were soon at the front. This was the
Nubian's place. There were two men, two women and two
little girls. All had what seemed very much like bed-sheets
wrapped closely around them. The older girl, according to
Johnny's estimate, was six inches through and about five feet
tall. One of the men had a belt made of goat hoofs. He
danced around awhile and then held out his hat for voluntary contributions.
A number of nickels and dimes went in, and then a
vigorous dancing commenced. The dance consisted in all
jumping straight up and down as stiff-legged and as high as possible.
The hat went round again, and the pennies and nickels
came in by handfuls. This made them wild in their desire to
give value received, and they jumped higher and higher, faster
and faster. Sometimes they forgot that they were in Chicago
and neglected to attend to the sheet with dexterity. But when
people are in Nubia they are supposed to do as the Nubians do
and not regard these little negligences. Some of the women
went out, but Johnny and Louis stayed in; and they kept staying
like a small boy at a free phonograph. They were studying
Nubians.</p>

<p>After being satiated with knowledge, they remembered that
there was a Soudanese baby dance, the only one of its kind on
earth. They might be missing something. Then they wanted
out.</p>

<p>In the next place they saw the same kind of people and the
same dance. True, there was a baby eating some candy in the
back of the hut, but its jaws did all the dancing for it. This was
a swindle which the boys would not further encourage by their
presence, and they withdrew.</p>

<p>From this they went over to the Dahomey village. Like all

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page130" id="page130">[Pg 130]</a></span>

Gaul, Dahomey is divided into three parts, whereof Monsieur and
his staff inhabit one, his warriors a second, and his amazons a
third. The amazons are twenty in number and for the most part
are occupied in the pursuit of keeping their pickaninnies from
making mud pies with the drinking water. They live in a row of
long, low huts thatched with palm leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/image40.jpg" width="360" height="326" alt="image40" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"THE TINT OF A NEWLY BLACKED PAIR OF OXFORDS."</span>
</div>

<p>A rail runs in front of the huts and a board sidewalk, on which
the amazons squat to perform their toilets, mainly consisting of
the application of greasy combs to the half inch of wool accorded
them by their Creator to serve the purpose of hair.</p>

<p>Day and night they oil themselves. Other times they oil
one another. Their shining bodies reflect the glory of the noonday

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page131" id="page131">[Pg 131]</a></span>

sun. Their complexions when their toilets are fully complete
approach patent leather. Other times they stop short at the tint
of a newly blacked pair of Oxfords.</p>

<p>Inside the huts the amazons betake themselves to arts of peace.
A tall woman, clad in a striped loin cloth, was rubbing corn between
two big stones in a firm faith that eventually it would
become meal. The miller is the curiosity of the realm, for she
only has two husbands, both of whom, however, she saw fit to
leave behind her in Africa to mind the babies. In Dahomey the
hand that rocks the cradle does not bother about ruling the world.
Woman has her rights with a vengeance among those people and
man has fully recognized her fighting qualities.</p>

<p>They found the village tightly enclosed in a high board fence.
Then began a vigorous search for knot-holes. But every opening
they found had the walls of a hut before it. At last they
were partially rewarded by discovering a fault in one of the boards
where they could see past one of the huts into the enclosure.
Half a dozen of the backs of men and women could be seen
about ten steps from the fence. The people would bend over out
of sight and then back again. All kinds of conjectures came to
the boys. Louis suggested that they were "shootin' craps."
Johnny thought they were doing some kind of a religious ceremony.
The pressure of curiosity became too great to be
endured. They went around the corner and discovered that there
was not a single guard in sight. Johnny was standing the expenses,
and Louis was generous enough to propose that some
means be secured to elevate Johnny to the top of the fence. No
more intense brain work was expended on the Ferris wheel than
these two boys gave to the proposed elevation. It took mechanical
skill of the highest order, for the management had provided
for these emergencies, and there was nothing in sight to help
them. But necessity kindly became again the mother of invention.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page132" id="page132">[Pg 132]</a></span>

There was a small tool chest a short distance down the
back fence waiting for the wagon to take it away. It evidently
contained no tools, for it was quite light, and the boys soon had
it set on end against the fence. Louis got on top of this and
was able by tip-toeing to get an occasional glimpse over. But
not long enough to reach any conclusions as to the mysterious
ceremonies transpiring within. Louis caught hold of the top
of the fence firmly and told Johnny to climb up over his
back. The natives were too intent at their work to see him,
and he got astride of the fence without any difficulty, but in such
a position that he could not see what was going on. The <ins class="correction" title="original: eves">eaves</ins> of
the conical shaped hut were almost in reach. He moved back a
little and put his hand on the roof to steady himself. But, alas,
the roof was dried palm leaves, and instead of supporting him his
hand plunged through and before he could recover himself he fell
crashing over against the house, held there for a moment as in
despair and then with an armful of the hut held tight to his breast
he fell headlong to the ground. The excited natives in all styles
of dress, from the voluptuous mother hubbard, much <ins class="correction" title="original: abreviated">abbreviated</ins>
above and below to the heavy slouch hat and military overcoat,
all crowded around him in the belief that somehow he was intending
to destroy their domestic happiness. Johnny did not know in
what form the attack was coming and as he could not turn over
to get up without touching one of the natives he concluded it
wisest to lie still on his back with the portion of the hut
which he had brought down with him, remaining over him for
protection. Louis gave a mighty jump upward and got his elbows
over the top of the fence. He drew himself up enough
to see Johnny lying on his back so still and the natives gathered
around him gesticulating wildly and talking in a very excited manner.
The sight was enough. Certainly, his friend was dead. He
gave a yell that could be heard to the beauty show, and jumped

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page133" id="page133">[Pg 133]</a></span>

down to the ground, calling for the police at the top of his voice.
The natives hearing the noise, supposed there was a plot to murder
them all, and one got a long-handled rake some workman
had left and began to pull the grass off of the prostrate Johnny.
Meantime, the frantic explanations of Louis that the Dahomeys
were murdering his friend brought a greater and greater crowd
to the corner of the enclosure. A number of guards came up,
but they had no key and no authority to break into the village.
Some policemen came up, but they were either powerless or
could not comprehend. No one had seen the accident, and
Louis was fast becoming incoherent in his oft repeated explanations.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page134" id="page134">[Pg 134]</a></span>

Meanwhile the crowd grew larger and larger, till hundreds
were gathered together. All the Plaisance was coming to see
what extraordinary affair was taking place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 352px;">

<span class="caption">"HE GAVE A YELL THAT COULD BE HEARD TO THE BEAUTY SHOW."</span>
</div>

<p>When all the debris was pulled off of Johnny he concluded to
get up. He tried to make them understand that he wanted out,
but they could not get his meaning, for he was so bewildered that
he was pointing in another direction from the gate. At last one
seemed to comprehend, and he ran as fast as he could go to one
of the huts toward which Johnny seemed to point, and returned
leading one of the damsels of the place who, from gorgeousness
of native modesty, seemed to be the belle of the village. The
native evidently thought that Johnny was in love with the girl,
and that he had taken this unceremonious method as the last
desperate chance of his life to obtain her. The native was presenting
her to him with all his natural suaveness, and was
apparently offering him the freedom of the town, when the gate
opened and two officers rushed in. One of them took Johnny by
the ear and led him outside. People were packed about the
place in enormous masses, and every available fence or elevation
was utilized by the crowd struggling to see. A dozen or more
policemen were outside endeavoring to handle the mass of
people. It took half an hour for them to make a way to get John
to the outside. When they saw Johnny, a great shout was set
up, but it only added to the fright that already possessed Johnny's
whole mind.</p>

<p>All sorts of stories were afloat among the people. Some said
the Dahomeys had captured a boy the night before and were just
on the eve of sacrificing him to their idols when a policeman
got track of what was going on. As some policemen passed
this part of the crowd they were cheered, cheer on cheer,
for their keenness and bravery in rescuing an American from such
a fate. Others, who claimed to know, said it was worse even

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page135" id="page135">[Pg 135]</a></span>

than that, for one of the policemen had confided to him that the
Dahomey people were about to practice cannibalism and had
secured the boy in order to eat him. A number were sure
that this would cause our government to have these people sent
back to Dahomey and as they were under the French government
and were brought here by French people it would probably
lead to an open rupture between the two republics and perhaps involve
all Europe in a struggle for national existence.</p>

<p>The reporters ran the rumors down to the very last prophecy
and sent post-haste their scoops to their respective papers and a
wave of indignation swept the entire country that cannibalism
came so near being enacted in the very midst of the greatest enterprise
of modern civilization.</p>

<p>The name of the boy could not be learned, nor anybody found
who knew anything about him, but there were thousands of people
who were witnesses of the rescue and bore testimony of how near
our nation came of being disgraced forever. The policemen
knew nothing about it. All they could say was that they found
the boy surrounded by the natives, and they since remembered
that he seemed too <ins class="correction" title="original: terrifed">terrified</ins> to speak, and the natives were greatly
excited at the presence of the officers. They had taken the
boy to the outside of the crowd and let him go. The natives
themselves could give only a confused account of how they had
heard a noise and had seen the boy lying near one of the huts on
his back and covered with material torn from the roof of one of the
huts. Their story was evidently absurd. Meantime the delivery
wagon had taken the tool chest away and thus destroyed the only
evidence that might have cleared up the case. The fence was
too high for the boy to climb over, and the Columbian guards
detailed to that section swore they always kept the whole village
in view, and it was impossible for the boy to have got over the
fence without being seen by them. Like the great wave of the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page136" id="page136">[Pg 136]</a></span>

sea that breaks into a million pieces as it strikes the shore, so
this great question resolved itself into a thousand theories, and
at last lived in the memory of the people only as the great
mystery of Midway Plaisance.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XII</i></h2>

<h4>BEAUTY SHOW</h4>

<p>Fanny was at the inn when noon came but the boys were nowhere
to be seen. She saw great crowds of people massed a
little way up the street but crowds were a common sight. She
heard broken narrations of some exciting event that had transpired
but there was nothing to cause her to think that her brother might
be the central figure of all the excitement. Johnny rarely missed
his appointments with her and she felt that something unusual had
occurred or he would have met her at the designated place.</p>

<p>She decided to spend the afternoon at the Libby Glass Works
and at the Beauty show. Once in the works, where glass is
wrought into the most curious and costly designs, a few hours
seems only too short for a good appreciation of the work done.
The art, as illustrated there, is as fascinating as a romance.
Three hundred people are employed there daily in showing what
can be done with glass. Entrance is to be had to the blowing-room,
in the center of which is the huge cruciform. In this there
are placed the crucibles, as the working-holes are called. The
heat in the furnace is 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>The batch from which glass is made is composed of sand, lead,
saltpetre, potash and soda. It has to be cooked in the terrible
heat for twenty-four hours before it is fit for use. In front of the
working holes are the workmen. A long steel tube is thrust into
the batch and a quantity of the mixture accumulated on the end.
From the moment it is taken out of the crucible until the form is

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page138" id="page138">[Pg 138]</a></span>

completed the operator never allows the hot glass to be still for a
moment. It is always moving.</p>

<p>The second floor of the building is a lively place. It is here
that the cutting is done. The process is most interesting and
shows the highest skill of the glass-worker's art.</p>

<p>Opposite the cutting department is the glass spinning and weaving
department. The spinning of glass into fine threads is done
by means of a wheel nine feet in diameter which revolves twenty
times a minute. A glass rod is exposed at one end to a blowpipe
flame. When the glass is melted it is attached to the
periphery of the wheel and the operator sits with watch in front of
him. Every minute the position of the melting glass is shifted
until the broad wheel is filled, when it is stopped and the glass is
cut and taken off, made into the desired lengths and taken to the
loom. The weaving is done by girls on hand looms. Two hundred
threads of glass are woven <ins class="correction" title="original: alternatley">alternately</ins> with one thread of silk.
The thread is made up into napkins, neckties, lamp shades, bonnets
and hats.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 364px;">
<img src="images/image42.jpg" width="364" height="302" alt="image42" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"SHE THOUGHT VERY DIFFERENTLY OF HIM NOW."</span>
</div>

<p>Fanny sat down on a bench to rest for a while when, chancing
to glance to the far side of the exhibit she saw Mr. Warner,
whom she had formerly known as Mr. Moses, intently watching
the work in the looms. She thought very differently of him
now. Louis had hotly defended him against everything the confidence
man had said, and, of course, she now saw that the man
who had spoken against Mr. Warner was of the most abandoned
type of men. Somehow she felt that she owed him some palliation
for the rudeness she had exercised. It would, perhaps, not
be altogether according to the rules of etiquette; but if the
opportunity offered she intended to say something in explanation.
As he came on around her way she felt her pulses beat faster
and her face flushing under some strange excitement. As he
approached to where she sat, he saw her and stopped for a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page139" id="page139">[Pg 139]</a></span>

moment. When he came by she looked, up and he bowed and
was about to pass on, but she arose from her seat and he stopped.
He held in his hand some samples of woven goods, and he
remarked that he was making a study of these fabrics to see if
they were worth handling by his firm. The conversation led on
so easily and naturally that she forgot that she had something she
wanted to say in extenuation of past rudeness. She could not
help observing how totally different was this man's bearing and
conversation from the evil-minded man who had presumed upon
her acquaintance before. There were no questions asked; no
lead in conversation that caused her to speak in any way whatever
of herself or her people. In a few minutes he had passed

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page140" id="page140">[Pg 140]</a></span>

on, and she felt from instinct and reason that this man was a
gentleman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 345px;">
<img src="images/image43.jpg" width="345" height="282" alt="image43" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"THE LADIES WANTED TO SEE HER DRESS."</span>
</div>

<p>From this place she went over to the international dress
exhibit, more commonly known as the "Beauty Show." Here
were fifty young ladies chosen from as many different nationalities
in order to exhibit the fashions of the world in the highest
art of dress. At the front was Fatima, the queen of beauty.
Her booth represented a room in the Sultan's harem. On either
side, reclining on an ottoman, were her waiting maids, and at her
feet her special servant. All the magnificence of oriental splendor
surrounded her. A group of at least a hundred people were
continually crowding the railing in front. They plied her with
questions, and the ladies were much offended because she would
not walk around so they could get a better view of her dress.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page141" id="page141">[Pg 141]</a></span>

She could answer questions in nearly any language but Turkish,
and she finally admitted to some French gentlemen who were
quizzing her that she came from Austria, her foot servant from
the south of France, and her waiting maids from Paris.</p>

<p>That international beauty show is a wonderful and fearful
affair. The beautiful representative of Ireland is dressed in
green, and wears glasses.</p>

<p>"Arrah," said an Irishman to the proprietor, "raley now, is it
in grane all the Oirish girruls do be drissed? By the bones av
St. Patrig, 'tis the first toime Oi iver saw wan in glasses."</p>

<p>"The fact of the matter is that our Irish young lady is ill, and
we have engaged this young lady to fill her place," said the proprietor,
and he moved away only to hear the following conversation
with the typical Greek lady from the Ionian isles:</p>

<p>"Do you speak English?" from a visitor. The lady shook
her head.</p>

<p>"Do you speak French?" This In French by the same.
Another shake of the classic head.</p>

<p>"Do you speak Greek?" This actually in Greek, but it only
brought another shake.</p>

<p>"Sprechen sie Deitsch?" cried the visitor, with some impatience.</p>

<p>"Oh, ja! ja!" exclaimed the Greek young lady, eagerly, and
a general laugh went around the little group which had listened
to the conversation.</p>

<p>"Say, Bess," said a young fellow, nudging his girl and pointing
to the Queen of Beauty, "ain't she a corker?"</p>

<p>"Naw," replied Bess. "I don't see anything pretty about
her. She's all drug store. Anybody can see that."</p>

<p>"How d'ye like that, Mariar?" remarked an old Hoosier,
stroking his yellow whiskers and squinting at his better half, a
hawk-faced woman of determined countenance. "I tell yer

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page142" id="page142">[Pg 142]</a></span>

what. Mariar, with all your good qualities yer never could hold a
candle to that 'ere girl, could yer, now? Honest?"</p>

<p>"Benjamin! Come right along out o' here. Yer head's bein'
turned by these brazen-faced females. Why, yer'll be cavorting
around here like a young colt in a minnit or two. The idee o'
comparin' me with that painted young woman&mdash;me, your loving
wife&mdash;come along now," and Benjamin went.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/image44.jpg" width="361" height="327" alt="image44" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"THERE WAS A PERT YOUNG MISS WALKING THE FLOOR."</span>
</div>

<p>At the United States booth there was a pert Miss walking the
floor, monarch of all she surveyed, a typical Uncle Sam's
daughter. It was a sorry mistake when a dude presumed too
much on her patience or a smart young man made too free with

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page143" id="page143">[Pg 143]</a></span>

his remarks. She was always ready for them, to the delight of
the patriotic young Americans about.</p>

<p>Here Fanny found five young girls studying the United States
beauty with more than ordinary interest. Each of the girls wore
a badge, on which was printed C. C. of C. C., and just above
these letters were five more, M. K. S. L. N. A note book containing
a pencil was attached by a neat little chain with the badge.
There was scarcely a minute that one or the other of them was
not writing something in her book.</p>

<p>Dressed exactly alike and being so intent on their work, they
were evidently not ordinary sight-seers. Finally some remark
was made between Fanny and one of the girls and Fanny showed
her own note and sketch book and asked how they were keeping
theirs. It soon appeared that these five girls were in a contest of
more than ordinary interest. An enterprising newspaper of a
Southern Illinois town had sent these five girls to see the Fair.
They were to be supplied with all needful money, to be independent
of all escorts, to take notes and write up their adventures and
their version of the scenes of the great exposition entirely unknown
to one another, and the paper would publish their reports
on their return. Competent judges were to decide on the merits
of their work and a handsome reward would be given to the successful
writer. In an adjoining town another editor had sent out
five boys on the same errand. The writers must all be between
twelve and fifteen. The one out of the ten who did the best work
was to receive a splendid souvenir medal. They were given ten
days of sight-seeing and their whole souls were in the work.</p>

<p>"But what can be the meaning of these letters C. C. of C. C."</p>

<p>"At home they say these letters mean Crazy Cranks of Cumberland
County but the fact is they have a meaning which is a
secret that shall die with us. We are sworn with each other
never to reveal it and to prove that girls can keep secrets. Of

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page144" id="page144">[Pg 144]</a></span>

course the letters form our club name, and it has the word Columbian
in it, but that is all we are ever to tell. We have a constitution
and by-laws and regular meetings for mutual protection
and advice in our trials and troubles." This was all quite interesting
as a proof of what the girls in the latter part of the 19th
century could do. Fanny and these girls at once became fast
friends, for she found that they did not live a score of miles from
her home, and that there were a number of people and home
places that they all knew.</p>

<p>"But what can these letters "M. K. S. L. N." here at the
top of the badge mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is no secret. They are the initials of our names&mdash;Mary,
Kate, Stella, Leila and Nannie."</p>

<p>They said they were not the only ones on a like errand, for
they had met a little girl all the way from Boston, and only fourteen
years old, who had been sent on the same errand by her
class in the high school, and they had heard of girls from the
south and west who were coming for the same purpose.</p>

<p>"We can't lecture," said Mary, "but we are going to help the
Women's Congress prove that girls have just as much brains and
courage as boys."</p>

<p>It was now nearly six o'clock, and Fanny was so interested in
the five girls that she persuaded them to go home with her to enjoy
the evening together. It promised a pleasant diversion, for
the five girls had been hard at work several days and had not met
a single acquaintance or congenial friend.</p>

<p>When Fanny arrived at her hotel that evening with the five
girls, it was to discover Uncle and Aunt in consternation over an
extraordinary story told by Johnny, who had arrived home an
hour or two before. According to his story, he and Louis had
tried to see into the Dahomey village. He did not know that it
was wrong. He missed his balance and fell over the fence. He

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page145" id="page145">[Pg 145]</a></span>

was scared and stunned by his fall. After a while he heard Louis
yelling as if in great pain. Then two policemen came in and protected
Johnny till he got safely away. When they reached the
outside of the crowd which was all the time yelling at them, the
policeman told him to git if he didn't want to get mobbed. He
ran as hard as he could run in order to escape. Then he remembered
Louis was caught, for he had heard him calling for
help. Johnny came back around the buildings, but, alas! the
bloodthirsty mob had done its work and Louis was no more.
Johnny, now safely at home, lay moaning on his bed and would
not be comforted. Fanny remembered having seen the great
crowd over by the Dahomey village, but she had not dreamed of
such a terrible scene taking place. Altogether it seemed incredible.</p>

<p>"Extry papurs, all about de cannibal feast!"</p>

<p>A thought suddenly struck Fanny that if there had been such a
horrible tragedy as Johnny had told of, the papers would tell all
about it. She ran down to the street and came back with a
copy. She looked rapidly over the paper, but she saw nothing about
a lynching at the Fair grounds. Then the front page leader,
with its half a column of head-lines caught her eye:</p>

<p class="center"><i>"EXTRA, SEVEN O'CLOCK"</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>"The Mystery of the Dahomey Village deepens as<br />
the Investigation Progresses"</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>"The French proprietor avers that there was no<br />
attempt at Cannibalism, but he cannot<br />
make a coherent statement<br />
of the case"</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>"The supposedly bloodthirsty Dahomey men and<br />
amazons, said to be the most peaceful and mild<br />
in Africa. The natives contradict themselves and<br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page146" id="page146">[Pg 146]</a></span>

tell a dozen different stories. The Exposition<br />
management greatly alarmed, and the investigation<br />
being pushed with vigor. Horrifying disclosures<br />
supposed soon to be reached"</i></p>

<p>She read it over, then she read it aloud to sorrowing Uncle
Jeremiah and Aunt Sarah. The truth of the great unintended
hoax and misunderstanding began to dawn upon them. Then she
explained the situation, and Johnny was brought out to hear it
fully discussed. It was now clear to all of them, but what should
they do was the next question. They could not think of the
newspaper notoriety that the avowal of the truth would give
them. Anyway, it had gone too far for them to interfere.
Surely it was wisest and best for them to say nothing. It was so
decided. As ludicrous as it was, it had become too grave a
matter for amusement.</p>

<p>"Of course you will help us keep this secret, you girls?"</p>

<p>Not a word was returned but Mary picked up her chair and sat
down in front of the four girls.</p>

<p>"The noble and progressive association, C. C. of C. C. will now
come to order."</p>

<p>Instantly each girl sat prim and upright in her seat.</p>

<p>"Is there any question before this deliberative body of girls?"</p>

<p>Nannie arose and said, "Madam President, I believe it is proposed
that we add another secret to our list."</p>

<p>Leila had her note book out and was taking down the minutes
of the meeting.</p>

<p>"Believing that this should be done," Nannie continued, "I
move that what we have heard and now know concerning this
newspaper sensation we forever keep secret."</p>

<p>Stella seconded the motion.</p>

<p>Here Kate got the floor and said she did not think it advisable

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page147" id="page147">[Pg 147]</a></span>

to add another secret to their list for she now had so many that
it was making her life a burden in trying to remember them every
time she had occasion to open her mouth. Besides the case
would certainly be a scoop for them against the boys and would
make them famous and cause the "Weekly Express" to be circulated
all over the globe if it published the first true version of
the case.</p>

<p>There was a sharp discussion for a few minutes, in which parliamentary
usage was dethroned and confusion seemed to rule
but they were young women and therefore had not lost a word.</p>

<p>The vote was taken and there was but one voice in the negative.

<h2><i>CHAPTER XIII</i></h2>

<h4>SUNDAY AND CONSCIENCE</h4>

<p>Johnny could scarcely wait for nine o'clock of the next morning
to come around. He wanted to see if his friend Louis was
really alive and if he would be at 60th street gate.</p>

<p>Louis was there dancing about in a fever of anxiety. At John's
appearance the two boys went off to talk about their mishaps.
They had achieved more adventure than they had bargained for.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the papers?" said Louis.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have you told anybody yet?"</p>

<p>"No, and my folks thinks it's best never to say anything about
it."</p>

<p>"Then we never will."</p>

<p>"Say, Louis," said John confidently, "there was five of the
alfiredest best looking girls around at our house last night you ever
saw. Fanny found them at the Beauty show a looking at the
sights. They live in a town not very far from our farm and they
are coming over to visit Fanny before they have to go into school.
You have to come down and visit me while they are there or I
will have to live in the barn."</p>

<p>The agreement was closed and the boys passed through the
gates in quest of new adventures, as if nothing unusual had ever
occurred to them.</p>

<p>However, they instinctively avoided Midway Plaisance, and
decided to see what was on Wooded Island. They ranged

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page149" id="page149">[Pg 149]</a></span>

through the hunter's camp, through the Japanese Hooden, and
all over the island in the vain attempt to find something equal to
their educated fancies of fun. Somehow Louis learned that
there was to be a religious dance in the Quackahl cabin. Nothing
else could have a place in the boys' minds until they had
tickets for the show.</p>

<p>Inside the hut was a strange sight. Wanug had arranged four
of his warriors on the east side of the hut, and these formed a
quartet that produced the music for the fearful dance to follow.
In the center of the hut a log fire burned briskly. The warriors
had their faces smeared with Indian ink, and some of the beauty
spots looked like demi-semiquavers on a sheet of music. The
squaws, and even the papooses, were painted for the occasion,
and everyone of the Quackahls were dressed in blue robes,
ornamented with striking pearl buttons.</p>

<p>At a signal Hammasoloe suddenly sprang on the boards and
began the mythical movement known as the cannibal dance. It
was symbolic of a curious legend current among the Indians of
Vancouver island, of a strange spirit that dwells among the
mountains and spends most of his time eating the fat members
of the Quackahl tribe. Hammasoloe took the part of the spirit
and crouched down as if ready to spring on his prey. The sticks
beat hard on the plank, and the music for the dance began.</p>

<p>A squaw pounded on a square box, which represented the
Quackahl drum. Two warriors were deputed to watch Hammasoloe
while he circled around the fire, for the usual ending to the
dance is startlingly realistic. Usually the dancer becomes so
excited that he bites the arms of those present in imitation of
the actions of the great spirit on the mountains. Whenever his
eyes glared and his looks became ferocious the warriors grasped
his arms and quieted him. He disappeared behind a white curtain,
and a few minutes afterward out sprang another warrior

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page150" id="page150">[Pg 150]</a></span>

wearing a huge mask, representing a raven's head. The raven
is a slave of the spirit and is supposed to be represented by one
man.</p>

<p>But Awalaskaius played the part of the raven. His body
proved as supple as a professional contortionist. He twisted his
legs and whirled his head around and snapped his jaws in a remarkable
manner. Cries that made the ears ring accompanied the dance.</p>

<p>When Awalaskaius had finished, Hammasoloe sprang out from
behind the white curtain wearing a blue gown on which the figure
of the Quackahl sun was worked. The rays of the sun were
blazing red, and the man in the orb was depicted winking in a
gracious manner.</p>

<p>Louder grew the noise, and the quartet taunted the spirit so
much that he again disappeared. Then came forth Awalaskaius
with a duck's head mask, which is the sign of the great spirit.
Again he went through his curious contortions and scared some
of the ladies, as he snapped his beak dangerously near them.</p>

<p>When the dance was done and the boys were once more outside
they were quite satisfied with sight-seeing among savages
and were quite contented to spend the remaining days of the week
among the more prosaic and poetical scenes of the great Fair.</p>

<p>Uncle and Aunt had about walked themselves down in their
sight-seeing, and were now enjoying the comforts of the rolling
chairs and listening to the voluble information which the chair
pushers thought it their duty to impart.</p>

<p>Fanny was walking near them in a never ceasing enjoyment of
people and scenery. As they passed the Woman's building a large
number of women were seen coming out together. On going
over the viaduct two well dressed men from the Emerald Isle
could be heard in critical conversation.</p>

<p>One of them said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page151" id="page151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look, Pat! It's women again! Do ye mind that now.
Look at um coom out ov that new building. It's the Fair that's
bein' run by thim faymales. Soon they'll want to run the wurrld,
and they'll be votin'. The divil will be to pay in a man's home.
They should be taught their places at once. If my wife should
git that strong minded sure I'd be packin' her off. Dacent homes
are bein' ruined, Pat, and soon there'll be no homes. They meet
in clubs to worship the rich, and who will do our mending and cook
our meals? It's all wrong, all wrong. The women must be
taught their places."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">
<img src="images/image46.jpg" width="361" height="259" alt="image46" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"VOLUBLE AND PERHAPS VALUABLE INFORMATION."</span>
</div>

<p>And the poor man looked worried. He is probably teaching
Bridget her place today.</p>

<p>Aunt was looking wistfully over toward Wooded Island as if it
reminded her of home.</p>

<p>"I tell ye, I haven't saw anything as nice as them flowers.
They tell ye of the country, and its quiet over here. Ye get too

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page152" id="page152">[Pg 152]</a></span>

much of a good thing sometimes out among the white buildings.
It's sort o' dreamlike over here, ye know."</p>

<p>She was right, it is dreamlike and it is restful. Din and
noise are far away and nothing breaks the stillness but the faint
music as it floats down from the plaza. The azalias are in full
bloom, and orchids and pansies and nearly every other blossom
meet you at every turn.</p>

<p>They stopped at a place where a number of people were looking
up at the roof of the Liberal Arts building. Countless small
black specks could be seen moving along the roof. Then it was
perceived that those specks were really men and women. It is
only by such a comparison that they could realize the vastness of
these buildings.</p>

<p>"What a jumble of bigness all this is!" Aunt exclaimed,
"them people look just like flies on the ceiling or swallows on the
peak of our new barn."</p>

<p>The chair pushers took them slowly through Wooded Island.</p>

<p>"What was that, Fanny, that you used to tell me about Alladin
and his wonderful lamp?" said Uncle. "I keep a thinking' of
that story every time I try to picture all these things at once.
Here is fifteen acres of fairy land just like in the fairy books I
used to buy for Mary."</p>

<p>They then went on with the crowd past the Government building
and the Liberal Arts hall to the basin. On the viaduct, over
behind the Statue of the Republic, they stopped to look over that
never-fading picture there presented to view. Over the peristyle
were written some of the sayings of great men. Fanny read
one that heightened the scene into a thrill of thankfulness and
patriotism: "We here highly resolve that government of the
people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish from
the earth."</p>

<p>"Now," said Aunt. "I believe I know the meaning of this vast

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page153" id="page153">[Pg 153]</a></span>

expenditure of money and energy. It is not only to show us and
others that we have not all the brains; that we are not doing all
that is done, but to teach us mutual gratitude for the great
privileges of our republic, and fix firm the resolve in the breast
of every man that our government of freedom and conscience
shall live forever."</p>

<p>They went on out to the pier and dismissed their chairs for
seats in the cool lake breeze, where they could see the people
coming off of the steamers and approaching them down the long
pier on the moving sidewalk.</p>

<p>Wearied with the constant commotion in which they had never
been before, it was decided to return home and to spend the remainder
of the week in rest and recuperation for another struggle
with the world of culture in Jackson Park.</p>

<p>When Sunday came. Uncle was told that the Fair would be
opened for visitors. He had been so busy sight-seeing that he
had not read the papers or he would have known better. He did
not know just what to do on that day, whether to go to church, or
the parks, or the Fair, but he was anxious to see what the Fair
looked like with most of the people promenading the streets all in
their Sunday best. He came to Chicago to see the sights and
seeing sights never appeared to him to be wrong. Every Sunday
it was his custom to go out into the pasture and look at his jerseys,
congratulate himself on how fast his herd was increasing, and
contemplate the prospects for the future. Grass grew, the birds
sang, the cattle bellowed, and nature was as bright on Sunday as
any other day. Besides he had some neighbors who believed that
Saturday was the holy Sabbath and he had never been able to
disprove their arguments. He believed on general principles that
the Fair should be closed on Sundays and that the grass ought not
to grow, but since the grass did grow, he would profit by the increase

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page154" id="page154">[Pg 154]</a></span>

and if the Fair was opened on Sundays, he would not miss
its magnificent object lessons.</p>

<p>"Ah, Jeremiah," said Aunt, "every one of them big buildings
comes over my spirit like a prayer and when I go inside I see the
answer and the benevolence of God. To shut people out is like
padlocking the orchards on Sunday, and stopping the machinery
that makes the apples grow. Six days are the rich men's days
and God made the Sabbath for the poor. Because our neighbor
raises hogs and eats pork it is none of our business because we
raise Jerseys and drink milk. The Good Book says: "Let no
man, therefore, judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of
any holy day, or of the new moon, or of the Sabbath <ins class="correction" title="original: second closing quote missing">days.""</ins></p>

<p>They concluded to go back home and then stroll out, and in
their walk to go into the first church they found.</p>

<p>They did so, and came into a great church just in time to hear
the minister read the text: "And God said unto Jonah, Doest
thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to
be angry, even unto death. Then said the Lord, thou hast had
pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither madest
it grow, which came up in a night and perished in a night; and
should I not spare Nineveh?"</p>

<p>Uncle Jeremiah listened for the story of Jonah and the gourd
to be applied in some way for a lesson to the hearers, but only
once, when the minister told what he had seen in Palestine, did
he become intelligible to Uncle. It was all so transcendently ethical.
Uncle got a remote idea that Chicago was to be likened to
Nineveh, and the gourd to the World's Fair, but when the sermon
was done, and all said, he felt that he would have enjoyed the
hour so much better in some of the quiet shades of one of the
parks, where he would have heard so reverently the still small
voice of nature's teachings.</p>

<p>After noon they went to Lincoln Park, and as they stood before

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page155" id="page155">[Pg 155]</a></span>

Lincoln's statue, Aunt said: "This is greater than any sermon I
ever heard." They read the words and sat on the bench encircling
the statue, while Fanny read the sayings of Lincoln chiseled
on the stone. Then they visited Grant's monument. They sat
down on the stone steps and looked at the noble figure. Uncle
was carried away with a religious patriotism that held all the
emotions of divine presence.</p>

<span class="caption">"THIS IS GREATER THAN ANY SERMON I EVER HEARD."</span>
</div>

<p>"There," said Aunt, "we are listening to another sermon that
can not be surpassed by the tongues of men. A whole life of
great deeds for our country is here speaking to us. No man can
be a bad man if he were to come every Sunday and give his
emotions up to the lessons of the lives of Grant and Lincoln.
Divine emotion is not aroused alone by words from the pulpit or

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page156" id="page156">[Pg 156]</a></span>

the silent walls of a house. Seeing is as great a means of God
as hearing, but seeing receives its sermons from the infallible;
hearing listens to that which may come only from the brain."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 259px;">
<img src="images/image48.jpg" width="259" height="337" alt="image48" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"THE POLICEMAN CAME OUT OF THE BOX AND WALKED RAPIDLY DOWN THE STREET."</span>
</div>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when the four of them got off the cable
car at Monroe and Dearborn streets and walked leisurely toward their
hotel. At one of the street corners they saw a policeman come out of the
patrol box and walk rapidly down the street. In a moment more he was
joined by three other policemen from another street. Uncle turned to
watch them, when suddenly they began to run, then faster, almost as in a
race.</p>

<p>"Sure they're going to arrest somebody," said John, and he

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page157" id="page157">[Pg 157]</a></span>

started after them at break-neck speed with visions of a murder
probably being done just around the corner. Uncle became excited
also and started after them followed by Aunt and Fanny, not
knowing what else to do. Uncle and John reached the corner
breathless and looked each way to see where the robbery or murder
was being done, but what was their disgust to see the three
policemen climbing into a cable car and calmly taking a seat. It
was an outrageous sell on all of them, but it could not be helped,
and there was no law by which they could sue the policemen for
a false alarm. They had the right to run to catch a car if they
wanted to. The family went on more deliberately now for they
had no breath to spare and there was but little to be said. Uncle
felt that Chicago was very much of a mockery anyhow. But he
had seen enough to make him desire to see more.</p>

<p>The tremendous puffing and blowing of a tug was heard somewhere
in the river and they concluded to go over to the bridge
and see what it was. There was a mystery anyway about how
those big boats got past the bridges.</p>

<p>Uncle and Aunt walked on over the bridge but John and
Fanny stopped to hear the music made by a cornet band of girls
on one of the excursion steamers. The tall masts of a lumber
boat could be seen coming rapidly toward them in tow with an
insignificant little steamer. There was a jing-aling two or three
times of a bell hid somewhere in the framework of the bridge,
teamsters and people were hurrying across, and all at once the
bridge began to move. Johnny saw some people remaining on
the bridge and catching Fanny by the hand he cried. "Here let's
take a ride" and in a moment they were swayed <ins class="correction" title="original: passed">past</ins> the street
and out over the stream. Over at the other end they saw Uncle
and Aunt holding desperately on to the railing. They had not
been able to get over when the bridge moved away. Presently
the boats were past and the bridge rapidly swung into place. Down

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page158" id="page158">[Pg 158]</a></span>

the street half a block Johnny saw some steam issuing from the
middle of the street. Instantly the idea of a volcanic eruption in
the middle of Chicago possessed his mind. He called Fanny's
attention to it and their curiosity was greatly excited. They had
heard that Chicago was a very wicked place and their preacher
had once remarked that he would not be surprised at any time to
hear of an upheaval by the Lord sending the city over into the
lake. In considerable dread lest the overthrow was about to take
place, they walked towards the place along the sidewalk, as the
famous Harry walked up to the guidepost at the country crossroads
on that cloudy night so long ago. But they were greatly
reassured when they found the people about them were so indifferent
and they were chagrined to learn that they were again
deceived. It was no volcano, there would be no terrible cataclysm,
it was only an inoffensive man-hole to the sewers, into
which the waste steam of one of the factories near by was
escaping.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Uncle and Aunt had stepped off of the bridge and
were intensely bewildered all at once to find that the excursion
steamer and the houses next to it had all apparently jumped across
the river to their side.</p>

<p>"Did we come acrost that bridge?" Uncle asked.</p>

<p>"I know we never."</p>

<p>"How did we git acrost without coming acrost?"</p>

<p>"I can't see how anybody could come across without comin'
across, and I know we never," said Aunt.</p>

<p>"Well, ef we hain't acrost, then the houses are acrost, and it
is more natural fer us ter be crazy than for the houses to get
acrost."</p>

<p>"Ask the policeman."</p>

<p>Uncle went up to the policeman and said: "Say, Mister, we

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page159" id="page159">[Pg 159]</a></span>

want to know if you will be so kind as to tell us ef we are acrost
or not acrost."</p>

<p>"Do you mean on the north side or the south side?"</p>

<p>"No; I mean on this side or the other side."</p>

<p>"Well, which side did you come from?"</p>

<p>"I thought I came from the other side," said Uncle, "but it
seems now as if I came from this side and didn't go over to the
other side at all."</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" asked the policeman, making a
mighty effort to untangle himself.</p>

<p>Uncle was becoming impatient.</p>

<p>"I tell you I've been acrost that river 'cause I walked acrost,
and then I never walked acrost again, and here I am not acrost,
and I want to know how I got back acrost again."</p>

<p>"Say, old lady!" said the policeman, "ain't he crazy?"</p>

<p>"This is the first time I really ever thought so. We've been
seeing too much, and I guess we're both crazy."</p>

<p>"In that case," replied the officer, "I am compelled to take
charge of you."</p>

<p>"O Grandma!" cried Fanny, just then running up, "ain't this
great. Johnny and I have been nearly half an hour trying to
figure out how we got across the river, and I found out first.
You see the bridge just went straight half around, and so when
we got on this end here it carried us around to the other side and
carried you back around to this side."</p>

<p>"Bless the Lord!" said Uncle, fervently; "Sarah and me
ain't crazy yet, and the policeman needn't worry himself." But
the policeman was gone.</p>

<p>"You see, Fanny, we couldn't make it out, and Sarah and me
and the policeman all agreed that we was stark gone daft."</p>

<p>Uncle and Aunt now had enough for one day, and they heartily
wished they were back on the farm. But they swallowed their

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page160" id="page160">[Pg 160]</a></span>

discomfiture: and, after a good night's test at home, determined
to visit the Board of Trade, where Bob Simmons had lost the
fortune his father left him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 363px;">
<img src="images/image49.jpg" width="363" height="322" alt="image49" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"IS THEM THE FELLERS THAT THE FARMERS IS AFRAID OF?"</span>
</div>

<p>Uncle and family did not get around to the Board of Trade till
nearly eleven o'clock the next morning. There was a wide entrance
with a stairway on either side. Uncle saw the people in
front of him, and he was accustomed to pass right in among the
congregation and take his seat in the amen corner. He did not
notice that the others had stopped at the door, but he plunged
right ahead. The door-keeper evidently had his attention engaged
at something else, for he let Uncle walk on in. Some
one at the door spoke to the ladies and told them to take the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page161" id="page161">[Pg 161]</a></span>

left stairway to the gallery. They reached there just in time to
see Uncle in a difficulty below. A young man had him by the
arm and was pointing very vigorously toward the door.</p>

<p>"Who do you want to see, sir?"</p>

<p>"I want to see the Board of Trade. Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Go outside and up the stairs into the galleries and you
can see it all you want to, but not here."</p>

<p>Uncle did as he was bid, but found that he was quite widely
separated from his family, because he had been sent up the
opposite stairway from them.</p>

<p>"I came up to see the Board of Trade," he said, confidently,
to a well-dressed stranger next to him.</p>

<p>"Well, there it is in all its glory," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see! The board is that table where them fellers is a
tickin' them machines. You see I thought they would be a
setting and a trading across a long, wide board like they used to
do at the country stores for counters. But them fellers down
there acts like a lot of lunatics. I don't see how they can ever
come to a bargain, yelling and spewing around that way. And
then I don't see the bulls and bears that change the market."</p>

<p>The stranger thought it a useless job to try to enlighten him.</p>

<p>When Uncle and his family came down, he went up to the
doorkeeper and asked, "Say, do you belong here?" The
keeper nodded. "Did you know Bill Simmons what lost five
thousand dollars here last year?" The door keeper shook his
head. "Well, say, I just want to ask one more question. Are
them people down there the bulls and bears themselves, and are
they the Board of Trade and are they the people that the farmers
are so afraid of?" The keeper nodded.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Uncle, "I've got this to say; any set of
farmers as is fools enough to be afraid of them yelling idiots, aint
got no backbone at all."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page162" id="page162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>Chicago was unsettling many of Uncle's ideas, and he began to
decide that the only real, bonafide thing he could swear by was
his own farm, and that the great outside world was only a great
circus of art and extravagant genius.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XIV</i></h2>

<h4>SIGHT-SEEING GALORE</h4>

<p>Under promises of gorgeous sights and full protection, Fanny
had concluded to visit the chief Midway Plaisance theaters with
Johnny and Louis as escorts. The "Midway," as it is familiarly
called, is undoubtedly the most unique and interesting pleasure-walk
in the world. It is a thoroughfare of ever-shifting scenes
and ever-recurring incidents. Fanny was not sure she ought to
go, and Johnny could not comprehend why she did not go with
him as readily wherever he proposed as she did on the wild free
life of the big Jersey farm. But this was to her a supremely
different existence, and she tried hard to recall all she had seen
and heard and read of etiquette and the proprieties. Uncle and
Aunt were not the only ones who were bewildered at every step
by the amazing mixture of reality and art, of fact and fancy, of
nature and imitation. They felt as if their souls were living
apart, and that they were mere automatons in a panoramic world.</p>

<p>Johnny had seen the Soudanese and Nubian play actors just
before his disastrous attempt to be informed concerning the
Dahomey village. But some scoffers from the South had spoiled
part of the novelty of it by alleging that the men of northern
Africa were really natives of Mississippi or Louisiana, and were
dancing only plantation hoe-downs in slow time and increased perpendicular
action.</p>

<p>But without question the high histrionic art of the Chinese,
Javanese, Turkish and Algerian actors ought to be seen. Maybe

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page164" id="page164">[Pg 164]</a></span>

it was strangeness rather than excellence and novelty rather than
entertainment that drew the people but strangeness and novelty
are the greater excellence when people come to see wonders.</p>

<p>The Chinese theater is by far the most pretentious. It was
pretty well advertised to the world at the advent of the actors in
Vancouver and their encounter with the custom officers. They
came to Chicago several hundred strong and are housed in
the big blue-and-gilt structure with trim pagodas near the
Cottage Grove end of the Midway. Entrance to the theater
is through a big tea house, where decent-looking Chinamen
who do not look like rats and whose fluent English proclaims
their long sojourn in "Flisco," serve the cheering cup at from 10
to 60 cents, according to the pliability of the victim. They are
doing a business worthy of a better cause. The tea house is but
the ante-chamber to a joss house overhead, mendaciously advertised
to be "the biggest outside of China," and to the theater
proper. The latter is not so big as the Chinese theaters in San
Francisco, but it smells sweeter, being over ground and not surrounded
with the cooking-rooms and opium bunks of the actors.
This is a concession to occidental taste which all but oriental enthusiasts
will appreciate. Nor are visitors allowed, as in San
Francisco, to inspect the green-room or sit on the stage.</p>

<p>In other respects the theater is pure San Francisco Chinese.
There is the orchestra, led by the man with the yard-wide cymbals,
playing the leading part. There is the property man, always
in evidence, who places a chair and says "This is a horse," or
turns the chair around and calls it a mountain. And there is the
female impersonator with deeply roughed cheeks, who is the pride
and flower of histrionic art. Women are not allowed to walk the
boards of the Chinese theater, but the male actor who best can
mimic woman's tones and mincing airs is the Henry Irving.
There is a whole chorus of these men-women in the Jackson

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page167" id="page167">[Pg 167]</a></span>

Park theater&mdash;an all-star combination. As for the piece itself,
they first play a little curtain-raiser of about two-months' duration
and then the real play occupies the rest of the year. It will be
all one to the American visitors, however, who enjoy the novelty,
so that they are allowed to quit when they like. And there is no
objection to that from the polite Chinamen in charge of the Jackson
Park theater.</p>

<p>The Turkish theater is across the way and farther east than the
Chinese. It is back from the beaten path and you might miss it&mdash;if
you were deaf. Having ears to hear you will be apprised of
its whereabouts at forty rods distance by the orchestra, which sits
on the front steps and discourses horrors on a sort of flageolet
and a bass drum. The orchestra plays only one tune and it plays
that hard. When a respectable house has been gathered by
these out-of-door allurements the curtain rises on a Turkish play.
It is a sweet pastoral of a youth who is lovesick and cannot be
cured by the doctor, by the soothsayer&mdash;by any one except his
love, who comes in time, and there is a wedding.</p>

<p>When this play was ended, Fanny decided that she had seen
enough of foreign theaters and declined to go further.</p>

<p>A Boston girl in spectacles sat near her through the Turkish
play. She told Fanny that she and her mother had been venturesome
enough to visit the other plays, and they sincerely
regretted it. She found a mongrel horde of Turks, Arabs, Europeans,
blacks, Greeks&mdash;everything applauding an interminable
song, whose filthy motif it needs no knowledge of Arabic to discover.
The singer was an Algerian woman, good enough looking,
after the pasty style of oriental beauties, young, agile and
mistress of the curious, droning guttural melody which constitutes
oriental music. She plays her part with complete abandon, probably
because she knows no better, and her audience applauds her
wildly for the same reasons. The Boston girl said she had seen

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page168" id="page168">[Pg 168]</a></span>

these same girls, or their professional sisters, in the Algerian
theater. But their performance had been modified to suit the
western taste. They sing and dance, but their songs and dances
are nothing more dangerous than a languorous drone. But there
are also some funny parts, according to the Algerian idea. They
are played by a jet black Somauli woman who joins in the dance
and a jet black Somauli boy in the orchestra who has a face of
India rubber and a gift for "facial contortion" that would make
the fortune of an American minstrel.</p>

</div>

<p>A look at the outside of the Soudanese theater is enough for
the ordinary curiosity-seeker. It is a little round hut of bark in
a dark corner of the Egyptian enclosure. Mahomet Ali sits at
the receipt of custom exchanging pleasantries with dusky flower
girls whose home is by the orange market beyond the Kase el
Nil, who know more French than English, and more deviltry than
either; who sing "Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay," and know how to
solicit backsheesh to perfection. The theatricals here are simplicity
brought to perfection. It is said their language consists of
only a hundred words. If you were to paint your face black, look
wild-eyed, stiffen your hair in many strands, array yourself in a
cotton garment that revealed more than it concealed, and then
were to jump straight up and down to the music of a dolorous
chant you would not be far astray. Add to this a whining and
interminable appeal for backsheesh and you might be very near
the mark indeed. But there is one Soudanese performance you
could scarcely hope to equal, unless you were to learn some sort
of devil's chant, gird your loins with a loose belt of shells and by
rapid contortions of your body make these primitive cymbals
accompany your chant. This is the star of the troupe.</p>

<p>Romantic people, who like to think of dancing as the poetry of
motion, can get a liberal education in muscular poesy by making
the rounds of the Midway Plaisance. They may see sonnets in
double-shuffle metre, doggerels in hop-skip iambics, and ordinary
newspaper "ponies" with the rhythm of the St. Vitus dance.
Slices of pandemonium will be thrown in by the orchestras for
the one price of admission, and if the visitor objects to taking his
pandemonium on the installment plan, he may get it in job lots
down at the Dahomeyan village.</p>

<p>In their "dance," as it is termed, they take a step forward
with the right foot, and drag the left after it. This is repeated
until they stub their toes on the orchestra, when they swarm back

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page170" id="page170">[Pg 170]</a></span>

and go through the difficult feat of advancing by a series of hops
on one foot. All of this is to the discordant pounding of drums
and scrap-iron, where tune could not be discovered with a search
warrant.</p>

<p>That evening Fanny visited the C. C. of C. C. and arranged
for a family picnic at Washington Park the next day. She was
to be hostess, and they were to have an outing with her in the
city's artificial fields and forests that would recall the merry life
of the country, and yet they would be surrounded by all the artistic
embellishments that money and genius could secure.</p>

<p>Johnny went post haste for Louis, and the two boys were made
bearers of the lunches, guides of the expedition, the vanguard of
the march and the responsible protection of the company. They
were eight merry young folks who took possession of the grip-car
on the Cottage Grove Avenue cable line that morning. They
stopped at the park hot-house and spent two delightful hours in the
wilderness of flowers and of palm forests. On the outside were
rustic seats about a pond where, in waters made tepid by steam
heat through iron pipes, all kinds of tropical plants flourished in a
profusion perhaps not excelled anywhere on the equator or along
the banks of the Amazon. The great flower clock and the immense
flower globe showing the geography of the earth, the old
English castle gate and the carpeted lawns showed them the skill
of the gardener's art. A quiet nook was found near the water's
edge of one of the ponds. With a newspaper for a table-spread
they enjoyed a lunch where hunger was a sauce better than
Worcestershire, and the sod a better resting place than a throne.</p>

<p>After their lunch and a good rest they returned to the business
part of the city and spent the remainder of the day in the Mystic
Maze, the Labyrinth and the Panoptican. These were places
where electricity and mirrors were arranged with the object of reversing
every conception the eye had ever given to the mind. In

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page171" id="page171">[Pg 171]</a></span>

one place the visitors entered a triangular room in one corner of
which there was a large vase of flowers. The walls were solid
mirrors and the six girls found themselves as if in a host of people
and a wilderness of flowers. From this they passed on into a
room which the attendant said was forty feet square and contained
thirty-eight mirrors six feet by eight set at different angles between
posts evenly distributed about the room. As they stepped forward
they found themselves among countless <ins class="correction" title="original: hoards">hordes</ins> of people, again
they were alone, all at once they found themselves in a line of
girls that stretched on either side apparently for miles. One time
they would be brushing around among people about two feet high
and two feet thick; again they would be surrounded by thousands
of girls eight or ten feet high and correspondingly thin. It was
exasperating to say the least. When they became weary of this
novelty they looked about them for the attendant but he had mysteriously
disappeared. Leila said she knew the way out and she
started with all the confidence that a usually level headed girl can
have, but alas! she nearly broke her head by running into one of
the big mirrors. Nannie happened to look in a certain direction
when she saw the door and the curtains about it as plainly as she
ever saw anything in her life.</p>

<p>"There I see the door," she cried, "come this way," and she
started with her hands out before her like some one feeling his
way in the dark, though it was as bright about them as the electric
lights could make it. All at once the door she had in view disappeared
like magic and she stood before herself in a mirror ducking
her head backwards and forwards like two young chickens with
their beaks just touching in the preliminaries of a fight. The situation
was becoming too serious to be amusing any longer.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" said Fanny, who had read of death in
the mysterious labyrinths in ancient times. The roof was low,
and even if the sky had been their roof they had no wings, like

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page172" id="page172">[Pg 172]</a></span>

Daedalus, whereby they might escape.</p>

<p>The girls began to get nervous, and several million of them
seemed to huddle together as they discussed the situation.</p>

<p>"I say, let's yell!" said Mary.</p>

<p>"But what is the use to yell," one said, "if they have determined
that we are to die here?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 348px;">
<img src="images/image52.jpg" width="348" height="336" alt="image52" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"THEY HELD TO ONE ANOTHER, AS IF FOR LIFE OR DEATH."</span>
</div>

<p>Now they were becoming really frightened. The picture of
their lingering death in that frightful crowd of specters was most
horrifying. Their voices were becoming tremulous and hollow,
and the terra-cotta figures of wild Bedouins that sat in a niche of
the far wall and was multiplied a thousand times, seemed to grin

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page173" id="page173">[Pg 173]</a></span>

at them maliciously, as if in anticipation of seeing their agonizing
struggles against death by hunger. The suspense was becoming
something terrible.</p>

<p>"I say somebody must yell."</p>

<p>"Let Kate yell, she's got a strong voice that might reach the
street."</p>

<p>Kate tried to do her duty, and she said, "Oh, Say!" in a voice
that would not have wakened a rabbit from its slumber.</p>

<p>She tried again, "Oh, say, we want to get out!" in a voice
so hollow that none of the girls recognized it as hers.</p>

<p>"Is ze ladies seen eet all they want?" said the polite attendant,
as he seemed to come before them at one step.</p>

<p>"Where were you?" they all cried.</p>

<p>"Why, I vas by ze glass about tree feet away."</p>

<p>"And you were listening to all we said?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I do not leesen. Eet ese my beesness to go out weeth
you ven you ask eet."</p>

<p>And then they followed him out.</p>

<p>"What a horrid place that was and we thought at first it was
so nice," said one.</p>

<p>"In all our lives we can never have a dream half so frightful
as that was," said a third.</p>

<p>"One thing sure," said Mary, "this terrible experience has
bound us forever and forever together; and because of our common
experience in this awful adventure we must initiate Fanny
into the mysteries of the noble order of progressive girls, C. C. of
C. C."</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XV</i></h2>

<h4>A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE</h4>

<p>Foreign theaters, mazes, labyrinths, panopticons, spectatoriums
and their ilk had no more charms for the girls, but with Uncle
and Aunt they spent the next day in the museums, casinos and
panoramas of the city. But wax figures and brain-muddling deceptions
were still the value they received for their money.</p>

<p>"I will be contented," said Aunt, "never to leave the farm
again. I can be happy there the rest of my born days in knowing
that when I look at a cow it is not a stuffed cow, that the calf by
her side can move; that the man on the barn floor with his pitchfork
in the hay can really lift it over into the manger for the
cattle. This mornin' I see a lady standin' on one of the stairs
tryin' to tie her shoes. She was having a time of it, I knew, so
I says, says I, 'leddy, let me help you.' She didn't say nothing,
so I jest stooped down to help her. I pulled the tongue of the
shoe up and tapped the sides together over it, when a perfect
chill came over me, for I pressed the lady's ankle, and it felt just
like sawdust. Poor woman! I thought some terrible accident
had cut off her leg and she had a false one. I looked up into
her face, and she looked so pale like and deathly that I was
awful scared, then I looked more and more and I see she was
dead, died maybe of heart disease while she was a stooping over.
O what a shock! I can not get over it to my dying day. I nearly
screamed but I knew I must not, so I just called to the feller sitting
at the table writing visiting cards to come there quick; but

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page175" id="page175">[Pg 175]</a></span>

he just set there stock still and never moved. I didn't want to
attract attention from the folks around so I just picked up a nail a
lying there and hit him square on the cheek but he never flinched.
I spoke then to the woman leaning over the railing laughing at
the little girl down below but she never changed her smile at all.
I couldn't tell what to make of it when a feller came up to me
an' says, 'Do you want anything, old lady?' I stared at him and
says 'Hist, sir, don't you see this poor woman is dead. Died a
stooping over too sudden.'"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 362px;">
<img src="images/image53.jpg" width="362" height="334" alt="image53" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"SO I SAYS, SAYS I, 'LEDDY, LET ME HELP YOU.'"</span>
</div>

<p>Then he just laughed at me a little, and pulled her dress to one
side and showed me that she was only a wax head and a stuffed

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page176" id="page176">[Pg 176]</a></span>

body. That made me mad, for it is a sin and a shame for to deceive
people that way, and defraud 'em of their hard earned
money. I told him to show me the way out, and I would report
how he was defrauding the public to the humane society or somebody.
He just laughed at me again and invited me to take a
chair in the office if I wanted to wait for my folks. I went in
there and an awful nice woman talked to me and explained things
till I wasn't so mad as I was; but I still think it is a shame that
a Christian city should allow such awful frauds on peoples' eyes
and nerves. Anyhow, when I get home I want to go around and
touch everything and make sure that there is no more foolin', so
I can live in peace and facts."</p>

<p>Aunt was very indignant. She could stand the deceptions that
Uncle had been so opposed to at the Fair, but when she was deceived
in her acts of kindness, it was carrying things entirely
too far.</p>

<p>The places of interest, as the guide books said, had now all
been visited, and they were walking down the street fully satisfied
that they had seen all the sights of the city from the skyscrapers
to the organ grinders. The police courts and the stock yards
were not considered as places of interest by them.</p>

<p>John and Fanny were in the lead, with the five girls just behind
them, and Uncle and Aunt bringing up the rear. As they reached
the corner there was a clamor and a scattering of people crossing
the street, and a rumbling that jarred the earth as two great fire
engines dashed by rolling smoke upward and clanging a bell in a
way that was frightful.</p>

<p>"Fire, fire!" shouted Johnny.</p>

<p>"Oh that's what we want to see, a fire, a big fire," echoed the
girls.</p>

<p>In a moment they were all running pell mell after the engines,
jostling against the people and exciting the merriment and wonder

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page177" id="page177">[Pg 177]</a></span>

of every body. The engines were running in the direction of
their hotel and very likely it was on fire and they would lose all
their clothing.</p>

<p>"Come on girls," shouted John as he led the way like a foxhound.
"Come on, I know it's only just around the corner. I
see the smoke rolling up from the house."</p>

<p>The engines had turned another corner and Johnny felt a great
pride in being the guide and encyclopedia of ready information for
six girls. Out of breath they reached the corner where they supposed
they would see a terrible fire with people jumping out of the
windows twelve or fourteen stories high, perhaps safely into blankets,
possibly to their death. Or, brave firemen scaling ladders
and bearing lovely girls out of the horrible flames. But they discovered
that the smoke they had seen was coming out of a tall
chimney, and that far down the street almost a mile away they
could get glimpses of the fire engines still forging straight ahead.
But they were not to be daunted thus. There must be a great
fire somewhere down there that it would take many hours for
the engines to get under control. On and on they ran, out of
breath, to be sure, but determined to see the great Chicago fire
that required two such great engines to bring under control. They
had run several blocks, when they became so tired they could only
walk. Another block or two was traversed, when they met the
engines coming leisurely back. It was a bitter deception, there
was no fire. They turned back; and, when they met Uncle and
Aunt, also entirely out of breath with the chase, Aunt declared
that this was only another case of Chicago's base deceptions. It
could joke with dead people and jest with fires and make a playhouse
exhibition costing many millions of dollars, and fool old
people and the young alike and with equal conscience.</p>

<p>Uncle observed that it proved to him that Barnum was right
when he said that a fool was born every minute, and that the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page178" id="page178">[Pg 178]</a></span>

Americans were a people who delighted in being deceived.</p>

<p>The girls decided to remain that night with Fanny, and to visit
the Fair together the next day. A pleasant evening was spent,
but the subject of fire and fire escapes were the chief topic of conversation.
Each of the windows of their room had a fire-escape
fastened to the facing, and the instructions printed underneath
were carefully studied and mastered by all before retiring.</p>

<p>The next morning they were gathered in the main room
awaiting the time for breakfast. Johnny raised a window to get
a look outside, when the well known clang! clang! clang! of the
Chicago fire engine was heard. Instantly all was excitement.
Clang! clang! clang! and another came by. Then there were
two or three more, and they seemed to stop right under the window.
People across the street, even up to the top stories, were
complacently sitting in the windows and looking into the street as
if such a thing as great flames lapping upward and smothering
them to death, were unknown. Johnny, who was looking out of
the window, yelled: "O Lord! it's our house on fire, and we are
five stories high!"</p>

<p>The streets began to fill with people. Uncle, panic-stricken,
looked out and saw the engines puffing below. The cool audacity
of the people at the windows across the street was appalling.
They did not care for death. All at once Uncle recovered himself
and yelled: "Everybody to the life preservers! Git into the
fire escapes and save yourselves!"</p>

<p>But the room was empty. "Oh Lord," Uncle groaned, "they
have gone insane and run down into the flames below."</p>

<p>Wringing his hands he ran to the door and cried, "Oh Sarah,
Sarah, come back and let us die together." But neither Sarah
nor the rest were anywhere to be seen. He was alone.</p>

<p>Remembering the instructions regarding the fire escape, he ran
to the window, fastened the straps about his waist and climbed out

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page179" id="page179">[Pg 179]</a></span>

of the window. He pulled the string that was to unreel the rope
and let him down. Down, down, he went expecting every moment
to feel the fierce heat about him. He seemed to be half
way down when the reel ceased to work and he hung there suspended
in mid air awaiting an awful death. He gave a <ins class="correction" title="original: dispairing">despairing</ins>
jerk when down he went within three feet of the pavement with a
sudden stop that took his breath away. A crowd of people began
to gather about him.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 349px;">

<span class="caption">"HE HUNG SUSPENDED IN MID AIR, AWAITING AN AWFUL DEATH."</span>
</div>

<p>"What's the matter old man," said a man who had seen all
the performance.</p>

<p>"Where's the fire," said Uncle wildly.</p>

<p>"It is two blocks further up," he answered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page180" id="page180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"And ain't my folks all burnt up?" he said pathetically.</p>

<p>The answer was at once before him for he had let himself down
directly over the entrance of the hotel and his family just then arriving
at the bottom of the stairway came out to him. There
never was a more happy meeting for Uncle than that one. His
ridiculous adventure was not clear to him till he had time to study
it over. But there really was a fire further on and they were not
to lose such a sight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 246px;">
<img src="images/image55.jpg" width="246" height="315" alt="image55" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"THE FIRE WAS TWO BLOCKS AWAY."</span>
</div>

<p>A large dry goods house was on fire, and eighteen or twenty
monster engines were puffing and roaring, each one like a threshing
machine on Uncle's wheat field. They pressed themselves
forward to the very front of the spectators, and so close that the
heat of the flames could be distinctly felt. A heavy wind was

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page181" id="page181">[Pg 181]</a></span>

blowing, and all the force of the fire department was out to stop
the flames. It was truly the grandest and most fearful spectacle
the family had ever seen. There came a puff of wind toward
them and the flames came down, almost scorching their clothing.
Then the policemen commenced to drive the crowd back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 366px;">
<img src="images/image56.jpg" width="366" height="344" alt="image56" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"SOMETHING HAPPENED."</span>
</div>

<p>There was almost a panic, and the girls nearly had their lives
crushed out of them. It was an adventure they cared never to
repeat. Johnny did not fare so badly, for he was more intent on
the workings of the engines. He was free from mishaps till he
chanced to take a position over the great hose-pipe through which
the water was sent with such tremendous force on its mission.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page182" id="page182">[Pg 182]</a></span>

Something happened. He is not able to relate just how it was.
But the hose burst directly under him, and he was tossed over
into the streaming gutter with a precision he can forgive but
never forget. After this happened it was time to go home to be
more agreeably clothed. Johnny was a sadder though a wiser
boy.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XVI</i></h2>

<h4>TO BUY A DOG</h4>

<p>Jackson Park was a paradise of peace and rest compared with
the nerve destroying difficulties of sight-seeing in the city. Uncle
had experienced all the adventures he wanted, and his great desire
now was to escape all further mishaps until he could get back
safe among his Jerseys on the farm.</p>

<p>Tired from much walking among the scenes of the Exhibition,
the family sat down upon one of the rustic seats in Wooded
Island. It was a most picturesque place, a most inspiring spot
from which to contemplate the great sweep of history that had
culminated on those grounds.</p>

<p>"The longer I stay about this Fair," said Uncle, "and the
more I see, the more I wish I knew. I can see folks discussing
things with such great delight when I can't understand anything
but the ifs and ands and buts. I heard a man say to-day that
Columbus never discovered America, that he was a pirate. He
said that all these doings should have been for a Viking or some
such name. I knew it wasn't so, for so many people couldn't be
fooled. How may that all be, Fanny?"</p>

<p>"There are a great many theories and stories set afloat about
the discovery of America by people who desire more to show off
their ability to construct plausible heresies against accepted
things than to give real historic truth. But there is much that at
least seems to be evidence of the Norsemen having been in
America 500 years before Columbus touched the outlying islands

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page184" id="page184">[Pg 184]</a></span>

of the West Indies. The Sagas of Leif the Lucky and Eric the
Red told some marvelous stories of discoveries to the southwest
of Iceland. Some of these stories seem to be verified in many
ways, by digging up the logs of the Norse huts, by the written
characters on Dighton rock, by the old tower at Newport, by the
Benheim map of 1492, and a number of other important things.</p>

<p>"Then there has been found what seems to be beyond doubt a
figure of Buddha in Yucatan, and also a Buddhist monument in
Central America. Therefore a number of people have been trying
to prove that Hwul Shan of China, discovered America ages
ago. There are likewise well established the claims of the Phenicians
and Greeks and even the Welsh and the Irish. But all
of these were fruitless till Columbus in his high aspirations to become
a great prince over unknown countries and to spread the
Christian religion of his day, opened the way for the course of
Western empire."</p>

<p>"But Fanny," said Uncle. "I heard the man say that Columbus
didn't know anything and had no chance to learn."</p>

<p>"Yes, Father, this glorious year has taught to the students all
over this country the beginning history of our great republic even
as this Fair is teaching the progress of the world. Though Columbus
was the greatest man of his age, yet we know only that he
was the son of a wool comber and that he attended the school at
Pavia, where he showed a marvellous aptitude for astronomy and
cosmography. He became a sailor on the Mediterranean, some
say a pirate, but the ships of one nation then preyed on the ships of
another and considered it legitimate because there was then no
International law. He married the daughter of an Italian named
Palestrello, who had been a celebrated Portuguese sailor. With
her he received many valuable charts, journals and memoranda.
He soon moved to Lisbon, which was then the center of everything
speculative and adventurous in geographical discovery. Columbus

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page185" id="page185">[Pg 185]</a></span>

made a living here by making maps. Here he studied out
his theory that he could reach Asia by going west, and he made
several voyages to the Azores and Canary islands, which were
then the limit of sea navigation. Then began his travels for
help to carry out his wonderful plans. He took with him his
motherless boy, Diego. From place to place he went with a
heroism of patience never surpassed. The story of the rebuffs and
privations through which he passed will be the wonder and praise
of men forever. Weary and footsore and hungry, he stopped one
day before the Franciscan Convent La Rabida, in Andalusia, to
beg some bread and water for his child. Then came the mysterious
turning of the scales in the forces of human greatness.
The Superior of the convent happened to pass by, and, struck
by the appearance of the poor traveler, began to talk to
him. The Superior at once saw that no ordinary man was
before him. Grander views were never presented and greater
plans of conquest were never known. Christianity was to invade
Asia on its eastern shores and meet the irresistible forces from the
West. Columbus believed himself divinely inspired for this and
therefore demanded that he be made high-admiral, governor-general
and viceroy over all the land he reached and that for his
revenue there should be given one-tenth of the entire produce of
the countries. Such a far reaching demand as this could not
have been acceded to only by a doubting sovereign, and he would
probably have been beheaded with his puny crew of one hundred
and twenty men if he had reached Asia and attempted to carry out
such a wholesale scheme of subjugation.</p>

<p>"The months of this voyage were scarcely less full of treason,
burdens, and peril than the years that had been given to make
the voyage possible. A pension was promised to the man who
first sighted land but Columbus saw a light rising and falling on
the evening of Oct. 11, and on that account claimed and received

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page186" id="page186">[Pg 186]</a></span>

the pension. It is said that the sailor who really saw land first
foreswore his country and fled to Africa because of having lost the
pension and the honor of being the first to see land. This is told
by the enemies of Columbus to prove a sordid and avaricious
nature. It is also told that he took such exasperating and outrageous
measures to uphold his visionary schemes of conquest
and government as high-admiral, governor-general and viceroy,
that it became more than his home government could endure.</p>

<p>"His last voyage was disastrous, but whether from his own desire
for gold hunting, or because from the demands of his crew, it
can not be told. A man was sent to supersede him and chains
were placed upon the man who had worn the robe of royalty. His
last years before the public were even more bitter than his first.
Until his death he seemed to spend all his time in trying to recover
from the king his lost prestige, titles and possessions, but
they never came. He besought Ferdinand pitifully to bestow
them as a perpetual heritage upon his son, even if not to him.
In a letter to his sovereigns, he said: 'Such is my fate that
twenty years of service, through which I passed with so much
toil and danger, have profited me nothing; and at this day I do
not possess a roof in Spain that I can call my own. If I wish to
eat or sleep, I have no where to go but to the inn or the tavern,
and I seldom have wherewith to pay the bill. I have not a hair
upon my head that is not grey; my body is infirm, and all that
was left me, as well as to my brothers, has been taken away and
sold, even to the frock that I wore, to my great dishonor. I implore
your highness to forgive my complaints. I am indeed in as
ruined a condition as I have related. Hitherto I have wept for
others: may Heaven now have mercy upon me, and may the
earth weep for me!'</p>

<p>"He died in bitterest poverty at Valladolid at about the age of
seventy years. He was buried at Valladolid for a short while to

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page187" id="page187">[Pg 187]</a></span>

satisfy the Franciscans, and then removed to Seville by request
of his relatives. It was said that Columbus wished to be buried
in San Domingo, and Charles V. gave authority for this to be
done to the grandson of Columbus, and the family of Colon was
to occupy the chapel of the cathedral. But there is no record
whatever of the events of his burial at San Domingo. This is
accounted for only on the theory that Drake, the English pirate,
destroyed them when he sacked San Domingo.</p>

<p>"In 1795 Spain ceded San Domingo to France and it seemed
to the Spanish people to be a national disgrace for the bones of
Columbus to remain on foreign soil. There were no explicit
directions as to the exact spot where his bones were and it was
not known then that five of the family were buried together there.
What was supposed to be his ashes were taken to Havana but in
1877 while making some repairs in the vaults another tomb was
discovered in which was a strip of lead from a box which proved
that the place contained the ashes of the grandson of Columbus.
Then a further search was made; only a few inches from the vault
first opened another vault was found and in it a lead box containing
pieces of bone and human dust and on the lid was written</p>

<p class="center"><i>"D. de la A. per Ate"</i></p>

<p>which is supposed to mean "Discoverer of America, First Admiral."
A silver plate inside had inscribed on it the names and
titles of Columbus. This much decomposed leaden case was
placed, with its contents, in another case of satin wood and glass,
and all deposited in a vault so that the contents could be seen
through the glass. Spain could not think of giving up the honor
of having the bones of Columbus on her own soil, and the Royal
Academy of Madrid made an exhaustive study of the subject and
at last published a book in which they closed the argument with
the following words: "The remains of Christoval Colon are in the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page188" id="page188">[Pg 188]</a></span>

cathedral of Habana, in the shadow of the glorious banner of
Castile. It is most fit that over his sepulchre waves the same
flag that sailed with him from Palos in the Santa <ins class="correction" title="original: second closing quote missing">Maria.""</ins></p>

<p>After reviewing this history, which her interest in the great
Fair, and the great events it commemorated, had caused her to
learn, and after consulting her note book to be sure of her correctness,
there was a general discussion among them, which
showed that sight-seeing was not all they were doing at the Fair.</p>

<span class="caption">"Some bodies for the heads and feet."</span>
</div>

<p>It was now past noon. Aunt decided to go home; Fanny would
walk up and down the "Plaisance," and with her sketch book see
what she could do toward putting bodies between some of those
heads and feet she had drawn. Uncle and Johnny decided to go
up to the business portion of the city to spend the rest of the day.
It was a pleasant afternoon, and when they reached the viaduct
from the train a great mass of people were passing and repassing.
The great Auditorium building loomed up before them, with the
Art Gallery on their right and the Columbus statue on their left.
Under them trains were gliding by like long serpents, and out in
the lake fleet steamers and sail-boats loaded with people were
moving about like white spots on the blue waters. Uncle and
Johnny passed along the sidewalk in front of the hotel when
something at the corner caught their attention, and they came up
for a moment to look at it. Two or three men also turned,
stopping by him when he stopped. Then a few more came up,
and a ring of men began to form. Uncle and Johnny now
noticed that they were surrounded by people, and they attempted
to move out, but in vain. In a short time the crowd had become
so large that the sidewalk was blocked, and none except those
who were close to the center knew what the original attraction
was. The people coming over the viaduct and from far down the
street noticed the crowd too, and bent their steps also in its direction.
Some, fearful that they would miss something, began to

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page191" id="page191">[Pg 191]</a></span>

run. The contagion for speed spread, and soon the whole mass
were speeding up the boulevard with open mouths and wide-staring
eyes. Each was asking the other as he ran, "What is it?"</p>

<p>As they came in contact with the central surging crowd where
each man and woman was trying to see over the heads of those
in front, <ins class="correction" title="original: dispite">despite</ins> the fact that the object, whatever it was, was on
the ground, the question was repeated. But no one seemed to
know what had happened. People in the center of the crush began
to demand room and air. In vain they struggled to get out.
The people still coming over the viaduct would start into a run as
soon as they were on the street, and thus continually adding
pressure on the outside made the positions of those inside almost
unbearable. The crowd was now a pushing, clamoring one, extending
some distance up and down the sidewalk and out into the
street. The apparently insolvable mystery as to the nature of the
accident or cause of the excitement only made the crowd more
persistent and harder to manage. There were some who shouted,
"give the poor fellow more air." "It's a shame to crowd
around him like that." Then they would push harder than ever
to see what it was.</p>

<p>Two men pushing each other got into an altercation. One
struck the other, almost knocking him down. The crowd quickly
took hold of the injured man and shoved him out into the "outer
darkness," as if he had been a criminal, while the other was let
alone. Some shouted for a doctor, others for the patrol and
ambulance and the police. At last two officers came. After
ringing up the patrol they forced their way through the crowd,
which quickly fell in behind them and pressed on again with the
renewed hope of seeing something. The presence of the officers
only added to the general excitement, and people who had been</p>

<p>laggards or had left in disgust came back at a double quick.</p>

<p>When the police got to the wall of the building they found a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page192" id="page192">[Pg 192]</a></span>

man who had two Newfoundland pups tied to a string. The
patrol wagon was sent back empty, and the crowd, which had
been sold instead of the pups, dispersed.</p>

<p>When Uncle got out he took his bandana out of his hat and
mopped his forehead, as if he had just finished tossing up a load
of hay to Johnny on a hot day in the hayfield.</p>

<p>"Consarn them critters!" he said, "I was thinkin' of buyin'
one of them Newfoundland purps for Fanny, but the crowd was
so anxious to see the trade that I've got entirely out o' the notion.
I never see such curiosity people in all my life. The other day I
stopped at a winder, and before I got half through seeing there

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page193" id="page193">[Pg 193]</a></span>

were about fifteen people standin' around and lookin' over my
shoulder. I guess I can't see anything any more without tollin'
so many folks on that I'm liable to get crushed. If country folks
was half as curious 'bout things as these city folks, they might be
laffed at with some sense."</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XVII</i></h2>

<h4>CAIRO STREET</h4>

<p>"And so you call this the Anthropological building?" said
Uncle. "What kind of things has it got inside to have such a
name?"</p>

<p>"Well, Grandpa, if you desire to be enlightened scientifically,
I may say that it is a subject beginning with Adam and including
the whole human race. It is divided into five parts: zoological
anthropology, showing the differences and similarities between
men and brutes; descriptive anthropology, showing the differences
and similarities between the races; general anthropology, which
is the descriptive biology of the human race; theological anthropology,
which concerns the divine origin and the destiny of man;
and ethical anthropology, which discusses the duties of man to
the world and his creator."</p>

<p>"Do tell! it's a pretty big subject, and no wonder it has a
house to itself."</p>

<p>Inside they found skulls, skeletons, bones, savage relics consisting
of dress, utensils, ornaments and weapons with amulets,
charms, idols and everything pertaining to early religions the world
over.</p>

<p>On the eastern border of south pond was to be found the outdoor
ethnographical exhibit. Indian groups, Indian schools and
everything illustrating their primitive life and material progress.</p>

<p>There were objects, shell heaps, village sites, burial places,
mounds, cliff houses and the ruins of Mexico, Central and South

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page195" id="page195">[Pg 195]</a></span>

America. To see the same thing, and to only very little better
advantage, would require thousands of dollars and years of perilous
travel.</p>

<p>"The more I go through these places," said Uncle "the more
I feel ashamed that I did not do my share in bringing of relics.
Now I could have brought the old nightcap that sister Susan's
dead husband's grandfather brought over from England; and I
have a gridiron that my great aunt gave me to remember her by.
And there's the snuffers and the old wood-yard rake that my
grandfather made himself way back in New England, and the
dress in which my aunt Harriet was married, and the horseshoe
from the foot of the horse that killed cousin John's boy Tom,
and sister Hanner's gold fillin' of her tooth, which was the first
gold fillin' in our parts, and it came out just afore she died, and I
don't know how much more. Ain't they anthropological, ethnographic
biology or something like that?"</p>

<p>"I think, Grandpa, they would have been more useful in some
kind of a cabinet in the old settler's cabin, but we needn't to fret
about it any."</p>

<p>From here they went over to the Midway Plaisance. The
"Street in <ins class="correction" title="original: closing quote missing">Cairo"</ins> was to be opened with a great parade of some
kind and they wanted to see it. The natives call it <i>Mars-al-Kabia</i>.
In fact the Street in Cairo was all the curiosities of
Egyptian Cairo's streets crowded into one Chicago Cairo Street.
It was a splendid sight with its gardens and squares, its temples,
its towers and minaret made in the most Arabesque architecture
and ornamented with the most fantastic draperies. The inhabitants
had been directly transported from old Cairo across the sea
to Midway Plaisance. There were the importunate street venders,
the donkey boys begging and pulling at the clothing of the
visitors, the pompous drivers of camels beseeching the visitors to
try their "ship of the desert;" tom-tom pounders, reed blowers,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page196" id="page196">[Pg 196]</a></span>

fakirs, child acrobat beggars, Mohammedans, Copts, Jews,
Franks, Greeks, Armenians, Nubians, Soudanese, Arabs, Turks,
and men and women from all over the Levant, all in the gorgeous
apparel of the East, filling the booths or strolling about the street.
They were the happiest lot of Orientals that ever got so far away
from home. Drums were beating, camel drivers singing merry
songs, and a curious medley of voices which the earth beneath
them never heard before. At eleven o'clock somebody blew a
strange kind of horn, which made the small boy almost kill himself
in his frenzy to get near to see what it meant.</p>

<p>Musicians mounted the camels and began grinding out music
that was enough to frighten even a North American Indian to
death. At the first glimpse of the camels a team of steady old
horses, that probably were never frightened before, ran away with
the gravel wagon which they had been patiently dragging along.
Little Arabs and Soudanese ran ahead of the procession turning
somersets and clapping their hands in hilarious glee. There were
warriors hopping about and clashing shields and swords together
in mimic battle. In front of Hagenbeck's show the lions were
aroused from their slumber in the den above the entrance, and
they stood before the bars and roared at the procession. Then
the dancing girls came skipping along, followed by a bride and
her maids, for at last it was seen to be a bridal procession that
was celebrating the opening of "Cairo street" in Chicago.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page197" id="page197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/image59.jpg" width="323" height="574" alt="image59" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"Hurrah! It humps in front, jumps behind, and paces in the middle."</span>
</div>

<p>Here is the circus of the "Plaisance," where the visitors are
the actors and the clowns. Every hour can be seen a bevy of
pretty girls escorted by a brother or some dapper young man.
The camel drivers hail them. What a chance for a lark! "Let's
have a ride on the back of the queer creature," says one maiden.
"Oh! you wouldn't dare," replies brother. "Wouldn't I, though?
Just watch me," is the modern maiden's response. She approaches
the dromedary, which opens one eye by way of recognition.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page199" id="page199">[Pg 199]</a></span>

She passes silver to the hand of the dark-skinned menial.
The other girls giggle. A great crowd gathers round to see the
fun which experience has taught is coming. Now the bold young
woman is in the saddle, and holding tightly, as advised, to the
strap which hangs near by. The dromedary opens the other eye,
shuffles his rear and longest legs in the dust with a sound that
resembles the hum of an approaching cyclone, gathers himself
for an effort, and suddenly presents to the gaze of all beholders a
rear elevation notable for its suddeness and its altitude, if not
for its architectural beauty. Though catapulted about ten feet
higher than she had had any idea of going, the American young
woman does not scream. That would be unbecoming woman in
this woman's era. She merely presses her lips tighter together,
lets her smile fade away at the corners of her pretty mouth and
grasps the strap as if her life depended upon it. The crowd, of
course, laughs.</p>

<p>By this time the dromedary has shuffled himself some more
along the brick pavement and opened the ugliest mouth ever seen
this side the Nile. Now he shows his front elevation, and the
smile which had returned to the lips of his fair rider fades again
as the other end of the animated catapult is put into operation.
But only for a moment. The bystanders have only begun their
second laugh when the American young woman is seen to be herself
again. She is out for a good time, and she is having it.
The dromedary winks three times and puts a sinuous, swaying
sort of motion into his body. His fat feet and angular legs begin
to describe semi-circles. The saddle and its rider twist and
gyrate and revolve and stop short, only to start quickly off again
in some other direction, and the triumphant journey through the
"Street in Cairo" has begun.</p>

<p>It is a very narrow thoroughfare, this oriental street, and it has
no sidewalks. The crowd falls to either side. As the courier of

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page200" id="page200">[Pg 200]</a></span>

the desert humps through the lane made open for him, his rider
is seen smiling and happy. She knows she has a pretty foot, and
that it is neatly clad in red shoes with tapering points and the
most becoming of hosiery. She knows her figure is trim, and
that her cheeks are bright and her eyes flashing. Applause follows
her from the mosque to the temple of Luxor, and rolls back
again as her beast turns for the homeward march.</p>

<p>She has had a ride on a real dromedary, caused palpitations in
a hundred masculine hearts, and made 500 of her sex envy her
the possession of such feet, figure and nerve. But these are not
her sweetest triumphs. The consciousness to her most grateful
and satisfying is that the courage and the independence of the
modern young woman of America have been exemplified and
vindicated.</p>

<p>They must get their fortunes told. There were no gypsies in
this Cairo such as camp along the country roads or in the edges
of the villages and tell sighing swains about their loves. Here
was a seer imported direct from the banks of the Nile.</p>

<p>His father studied the stars and read lives from the palms of
men's hands. His grandfather did the same. He came from
a race of wise men. The first seers of his family sat in the
shade of the early sphinxes and told <ins class="correction" title="original: Egpytian">Egyptian</ins> maidens to beware
of young men who came up from the Red sea with false
promises.</p>

<p>But his fortune-telling was of the same kind as one finds everywhere.
A young man paid the price and held out his hand. The
wise man took hold of the fingers, bent them back from the hand
and pushed the cuff half way back to the elbow. He traced
the course of the veins, ran his coal-black finger along each
wrinkle of the palm, and all the time muttered to himself.
Sometimes he nodded his head and gurgled approvingly. Again
he hesitated and groaned feebly, as if the signs were sad. The

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page201" id="page201">[Pg 201]</a></span>

young man had a scared look in his eyes. Then the interpreter
began to tell what the aged seer had to say:</p>

<p>"He says that you had sickness. It was not long ago. You
were afraid. But it's all right. You won't be sick any more.
Have health, good health. Feel good all time. Don't be afraid."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear it," said the young man.</p>

<p>"Before you worked where you do now you had another kind
of work. You did something else. You will change. Not the
same kind of work next time. No, no. You will have good
time. A man will give you work. It is different from what you
do now. He is short, fat, very rich man. Go with him. You
will do well, make money&mdash;lots of money. Fat man will make
you have better clothes."</p>

<p>"Well, what's the matter with these I've&mdash;&mdash;," began the
young man, but the interpreter hushed him.</p>

<p>"He says you must stay in Chicago, good place. If you travel
you will not have as much money as you will have when you get
with the fat man. You must stay here if you want to be rich
and have good clothes. Aha! this is very good. Put your head
near. He says you are very warm-hearted, like all of the
women. Yes, yes, that's it, you love one in particular, your wife
or some one. He wants to know who it is you love."</p>

<p>"I am not married," said the young man.</p>

<p>"He says," resumed the interpreter, "that it's all right."</p>

<p>"All right, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you will marry her, but not this year."</p>

<p>"How long do you think you will live?"</p>

<p>"Give it up."</p>

<p>"You will live to be 87. He says so."</p>

<p>That was all, and the puzzled young man arose to go away.</p>

<p>"How was it? How was it?" asked all the women who had
been looking on and marveling.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page202" id="page202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said the young man. "The past and present
are both a little cloudy, but the future is all that any one could
ask."</p>

<p>Then he started away, keeping a sharp lookout for a fat man
who seemed to be rich.</p>

<p>At the end of the street is the Temple of Luxor, where the
curious pass under the deity-covered portal, and gaze upon the
reproduced wonders of ancient Egypt. They bend over withered
mummies of kings dead 5,000 years ago, and listen to music that
has not been played for ages.</p>

<p>Near here is the passage way outside, and, as Fanny came out
with <ins class="correction" title="original: here">her</ins> ears ringing with the strange jargon that everywhere
met her, she was at once relaxed from the tension of sights and
sounds she had just been in by seeing two country people rush
together just before her. One said:</p>

<p>"Well, what in the world are you doin' here?"</p>

<p>"I swan, is that you? What are you doin' here?"</p>

<p>"Oh-h-h, we had to see the Fair, couldn't miss it, you know,
not if it took a leg."</p>

<p>"That's right, that's right. Bring your folks?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they're around here somewhere. Mother's about
fagged. Says she'd rather cook for harvest hands than walk all
day. Going to stay long?"</p>

<p>"Calculate on being here all next week if body and soul stick
together. 'Spose you'll be here sometime."</p>

<p>"Can't tell yet. Just about give up seeing it all. Half the
time don't know whether I'm on my head or my heels. Blamedest
place I ever struck."</p>

<p>"That's right, that's right."</p>

<p>It was enough to cause her to smile at their homely enthusiasm,
and the striking contrast of language. It was a relief to

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page203" id="page203">[Pg 203]</a></span>

hear intelligible language once more, and in the rural dialect so
familiar to her ears.</p>

<p>The soft, balmy days of June were now in their glory, and
Uncle and Aunt sometimes spent nearly the whole day sitting
around on Wooded Island imagining they could hear their cattle
lowing in the pasture across the creek, and dreaming their lives
over again from their early happy days. It was so peaceful there.
Then they loved to go over by the lake and look upon it as a
painted ocean, as calm and quiet as a pond of Raphael. It was
something to see the stretch of blue go on till it touched the low-hung
clouds at the edge of the world. Beyond the mists and
the smoke of the white steamers were dimly outlined streaks of
yellow and light, which turned the whole heavens into a softened
sky of good promise. In the foreground of the vista the giant
figures of victory, with charging horses and chariot, and all the
Apollos and Neptunes, stood out like silhouettes. There was no
noise save the ripple of the water down the cascade at Columbia's
feet. Gentle winds lapped the waves along the beach, the furious
breakers of other days were toned into a delicate murmur, which
sounded very like some sweet symphony or the hymn of a winged
choir. Waves which had for weeks been tangled masses of white
caps and had thrashed with frantic anger the bases of the towering
pillars dropped to the dainty ripples of a summer breeze.
There was no crash, no roar, no splashing spray, driven on by a
gale that snorted and snapped. So delicately and silently did the
waters kiss the shore that sparrows and wrens and a flock of wandering
doves walked to the very edge and filled their crops with
the pure white sand. Then this, the best great work of any race
of any age, comes over the spirits of worshipful men like
heavenly benedictions of good-will and peace.</p>

<p>Sometimes as they sat in some quiet place alone saying
nothing but thinking joy, the music of holy melodies came floating

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page204" id="page204">[Pg 204]</a></span>

across the waters of the basin and re-echoed from the heaving
lake to the Administration dome. They were sitting at the
feet of that human genius which God had hallowed for the sake
of those who revere His holy name.</p>

<p>They were everywhere thrilled with the supremely gifted
achievements of their fellow men, inspired by the living canvass
from every clime, and amazed to know that the lumps of Parian
stone could be made to speak the heroism of the world.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XVIII</i></h2>

<h4>UNCLE IN THE LOCK-UP</h4>

<p>Our family felt that they could remain in the grounds forever
and never be done seeing; but the time was drawing near when
they must return home. Uncle decided that this Saturday must
be their last day at the Fair. Surely they had seen enough, even
if there was so much more not yet seen. They had seen notable
people all the way from the Infanta of Spain to Faraway
Moses, of Egypt. But they were all the same to Uncle. He
had heard all kinds of music, from the Spanish band to the
Samoan tom-tom. "Some of the music," he said, "was so
peaceful like, but the rest was not half so nice as the growin' pigs
rubbin' against splinters in the sty back of the barnyard." He
had surely been all over, and there was nothing more of a startling
nature to see. He had watched them check babies at the children's
building as if they were poodles or handbags, and he had
been over to the Irish village and seen the people kissing the
"Blarney Stone." On a card tacked near by he read:</p>

<table cellpadding="5" summary="note">
<tr><td>
<p style="font-size: smaller">
This is the stone that whoever kisses<br />
He never misses to<br />
Grow eloquent.<br />
A clever spouter<br />
He'll turn out an orator<br />
In Parliament.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Uncle had no ambition that way, and so he let the rest do all the
kissing.</p>

<p>He had completed his sight-seeing in the city by taking a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page206" id="page206">[Pg 206]</a></span>

Turkish bath, and he considered himself now ready to "pull up
stakes" and return to the farm.</p>

<p>"I've made hay in July, and punched it back into the loft,"
said Uncle; "I've harvested in August, and drunk out of the
branch; I've cut hoop-poles in the swamp, and done lots of other
hot things, but fer real sultuy weather nothing is ekal to the Turkey
bath. Some feller told me it was the healthiest bath a feller
could take when there was no creek around. You see, I looked
at the Chicago river and decided it wasn't altogether a proper
place fer a swim; then I went over to the lake whar they were a
paddling around, but somehow the water didn't warm up even a
little bit in the afternoons, and then I <ins class="correction" title="original: though">thought</ins> I might just as well
pay a dollar and take a Turkey bath.</p>

<p>"Well, it do beat anything in the wash line I ever see. I went
into the barber <ins class="correction" title="original: snop">shop</ins> where the sign was and paid a woman a dollar,
and she took my silver ticker and chain and all my spare
change, and my pocket book, and put 'em all into a box and locked
it and then fastened the key around my wrist. Well, I wondered
if I was a going down there whar they had to protect me
that way from getting robbed.</p>

<p>"I went down stairs where I stopped to see a feller a doing
some thing to a feller's feet. I seed he was a cutting the nails,
and then I thought how awful lazy these city people do get, that
they can't even cut their own toe nails.</p>

<p>"A feller came up and put me in a little room and told me to
strip off and foller him. Well, sir, that feller he just stuck me
into a room that was hot enough to fry eggs and bake Johnny
cakes. I dassent breathe hard for fear of burning my nose off.
He set me into a lean back chair and decently covered me over
with a sheet. I've biled sap, an' I've rolled logs; I've scraped
hogs over the kettle and made soap, but this beat anything I ever
see fer hot weather. If I hadn't seen other respectable folks

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page207" id="page207">[Pg 207]</a></span>

goin' in there I'd a knowed I was a gittin' basted for my sins in
the bad world. I couldn't set there, so I tried to walk around,
but I seen my feet was liable to get roasted, and the air was hotter
at the top, so I set down again.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, I sot there till I got hotter'n biled corn, and then I
hollered worse nor the Johnnies at Kenesaw mountain.</p>

<p>"Then a feller stuck his head in at the door and told me to
come out there, and when I did a colored feller shoved me on to
a bench and began to slap the daylights out o' me with both
hands, and then another feller he turned the hose on me, and
then I cut loose.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, you ought to a seed me. I'm gittin' old, but
'nough is 'nough, and I kin be painters an' wild cats when I want
to. I was in a pecooliar place without a stitch on me, but I jest
run the slapper into the bake oven, and I made the buggy washer
jump into the fish pond or swimmin' hole what they aimed to
chuck me into next; and then a feller came out and took me
into another room, where he rubbed me down kind a horse like,
and I got my clothes on and went up to the woman and got my
things give back; and I told her I was awful glad to see daylight
again. She laffed, an' I didn't say no more, but I done lots of
thinkin'."</p>

<p>They were sitting on a rustic bench, just across the southwest
bridge on Wooded Island, when Uncle's talking was brought to a
stop by a great noise in the direction of the "Plaisance." Just
then two Turks came trotting by with a sedan chair in which was
seated a nervous-looking woman who seemed anxious to reach
the place from which the medley of noises seem to be issuing.
She nervously grasped the sides of the chair and looked at the
bent form of the toiling Ottoman in front. Over the bridge they
went, the carriers executing a double shuffle diagonally down the
steep descent. The passenger opened her mouth and gave a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page208" id="page208">[Pg 208]</a></span>

scream that made the Turk in front stumble as he bent his head
to see what was wrong. Then she screamed harder, frightening a
flock of sea-gulls off the island and bringing a Columbian guard
on a run from the north entrance of the Horticultural building to
see what was the matter. Then she insisted on getting out, and
she was so glad, that she gave the Turk a dollar, and left before
he could give her any change.</p>

<span class="caption">"SHE GAVE A SCREAM THAT SCARED SOME GULLS OFF OF THE ISLAND."</span>
</div>

<p>The noise over towards the "Plaisance" continued, and Johnny
cried out, "The parade, the Midway Plaisance parade! Come
on, the whole earth is parading!"</p>

<p>The front of the procession just then <ins class="correction" title="original: apprared">appeared</ins> in view, and the
family went to the top of the bridge where they could review the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page209" id="page209">[Pg 209]</a></span>

strangest procession that ever walked on the western world. Processions
may come, and processions may go, but there never was
one like that which was then winding through the broad streets of
Jackson Park.</p>

<p>The column was over a mile long, and made up of men and
women afoot; camels, gaily decked horsemen, wild Bedouins
from Arabia's desert's; carriages, rolling chairs, reindeer and
dog sledges. From the fur garments of the Laplanders leading
the column, to the sea-grass, thoroughly ventilated costumes of
the Samoans, was presented a contrast that marked the display
all along the line. It seemed as if there had been a revival of
the Babel scene from the Pentateuch. It seemed that the confusion
of tongues had just come to pass and people had not yet
become accustomed to talk anything but Sanscrit or Chinese.</p>

<p>There was a gathering of assorted freaks not surpassed since
Noah came out of the ark, and an assortment of people never
seen before. When Mr. Moody preaches to the Midway Plaisance,
surely the scripture will be fulfilled as to preaching the gospel
to all the nations of the earth.</p>

<p>Then the bedlam of strange cries were heard again. These
peculiar sounds came from the Dahomey warriors and amazons,
black as night and stupid as pigs. In thin cloth and hair garments
that concealed just a little of their bodies, the blacks romped as
they sang and beat upon long cartridge shaped drums.</p>

<p>The noisiest part of the parade began with the Algerian village.
Drums resounded, <ins class="correction" title="original: clarionets">clarinets</ins> screeched, castanets clattered, and
the shrill cries of the dancing girls rose above all the tumult.
The girls rode in rolling chairs, and while they were not busy
rivaling the banshee of Ireland, they laughed and flirted to their
hearts' content.</p>

<p>The Chinese was the most gorgeous contingent in the column.
Costumed in rare and brilliant silks, ablaze with gold and silver,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page210" id="page210">[Pg 210]</a></span>

the Chinese actors and actresses made a brilliant appearance.
But it was the dragon that wriggled behind them that caught the
crowd. It was 125 feet long, and its mouth was big enough to
swallow a man without tearing his clothes on its fangs. When
it passed the beer tunnel in the "Plaisance," its glaring eyes
turned toward a man whose best friends have been to Dwight.
The man shuddered and drew a long and nervous breath.</p>

<p>"Take me away from here, Bill," the man said to his companion.
"I never thought I could get in this kind of a fix. I'm
a quitter right now."</p>

<p>From a distance it looked like a monster sea serpent on a
spree. It was really a dragon, at least that's what the Chinese
call it; but it was in fact the finest exhibit ever beheld of what a
diseased imagination can do for a victim of strong drink. It
could easily claim the prize as being the most terrifying object
on earth.</p>

<p>The people from the "Street of Cairo," afoot and mounted on
camels and donkeys, headed their part of the procession with
the Turkish flag, and swift-footed runners guarded the banner,
while men in rusty, antique chain-armor were near to defend.
A horde of fakirs and jugglers of all colors, from jet-black Soudanese
to fair-faced Greeks, pressed close at their heels, stripped
to the waists, with bare feet, and cutting up all sorts of tricks.
Swordsmen, garbed in long robes, twirling naked blades and
shields as they hopped about one another in imitation of combat;
more donkey boys; Nubians bearing carved Egyptian images,
one of which was of the sacred bull done in gold; bayaderes and
nautch dancers, not very good looking, but with fine white arms
and well-turned ankles and gorgeous in oriental robes and colors&mdash;all
flocked after the fakirs.</p>

<p>Then came the Persians, the women playing upon hurdy-gurdies
and singing a plaintive air more suggestive of melody than

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page211" id="page211">[Pg 211]</a></span>

any other native music in the line. The lion banner of the Shah
was carried proudly, and this detachment closed with a score of
Persian gladiators, naked to the waist. They seemed to be
superbly executed pieces of bronze set in motion.</p>

<p>The "Beauty Show" was in the parade. Blarney Castle had
several lads and lasses present, led by the pipes and a jig-dancer
as agile as an antelope and as tireless as an electric fan, for he
jigged all the way the procession marched. Then the Samoans
came along. Stalwart men are they, yellow-skinned and muscular,
and in their airy sea-grass garments, knee short and chest
high, they presented a splendid physical appearance, while the
women were pleasant-faced and fairly pretty. The men danced
a war dance while marching along, and their fierce wielding of
their clubs had greater influence in putting back the fast encroaching
crowds than did the oft repeated command of the
Columbian guard to stand back.</p>

<p>The South Sea Islanders, with nothing much more than
feathers and grasses about their bodies and on their heads, sang
a wild but tuneful melody as they brandished war clubs and
danced about, their well-greased bodies gleaming in the sun.
Three pretty Hula-Hula girls in the party sang all the time.
Their dress was very fantastic; short, full skirts of brilliant-colored
grasses fell to their bare brown knees. Flowers and
grasses were twined in their hair. A short, tight-fitting robe of
grasses and feathers fell over their shoulders and ended at their
waists.</p>

<p>The young women who illustrate all the various types of beauty
to be seen anywhere on earth, from Hong Kong to State street,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page212" id="page212">[Pg 212]</a></span>

made up the line. They were in carriages, and attracted much
attention.</p>

<p>The odd procession traversed the Fair grounds to the east end of
the Electricity building, and then returned to their respective shows.</p>

<p>It was now getting late in the afternoon and Uncle said, "Now,
let us be taking our last looks."</p>

<p>"Papers, Mister? All about the Sunday Fair."</p>

<p>Uncle bought a paper and read the headlines:</p>

<p class="center"><i>"GATES REMAIN OPEN"</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>"Courts' Final Decision in Favor of Sunday Fair<br />
Judges are Unanimous&mdash;Overrule Judgment<br />
of United States Circuit Court"</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>"Court Room and Halls Crowded with People<br />
Eager to Hear the Decision"</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>"The Chief Justice brushes away the Cobwebs of<br />
sophistry and religious paternalism by which the<br />
Sabbatarian sects sought to close the Gates<br />
against the Millions"</i></p>

<p>"I didn't see no millions when I was here Sunday, did you,
Sarah? And the grounds looked lots like a big grave yard, with
some people sad like, a wandering through."</p>

<p>The sweat began to come on Uncle's face. His big bandanna
was brought into play. "So they've opened it. Well, I don't
know, I don't know. It kind of worries me somehow, as if they
oughtn't a done it. But I don't understand all the law and the
gospel. I surely didn't do no wrong when I thought seeing the
Fair on Sunday was right, if it do disturb me like, just now. I
thought our Savior meant seeing the Fair on Sunday when he said
'It is lawful to do well on the Sabbath day.' But when I see
the beer tunnel full of people, and the furrin theayters a runnin',
it didn't look lawful, and I wisht I was back to our old church a
sittin' in the corner. Anyhow, I hope I didn't do any of it."</p>

<p>Uncle walked on slowly in a very sad and meditative mood.
Aunt looked as if there was something that had overthrown all

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page213" id="page213">[Pg 213]</a></span>

her high sentiment on her first Sunday of seeing the entrancing
visions of the great Exposition. There were religious realities
touching her soul now, and she walked on rapidly with Fanny,
leaving Uncle behind. Johnny was flipping pebbles at some
ducks in the lagoon and Uncle had stopped to look in at one of
the doors of Liberal Arts hall. While he was standing there
two dapper young men came walking hastily by. One caught
sight of Uncle and quickly uttered a low whistle. His companion
stopped short as the first one said: "Der's de old duffer; let's
work him."</p>

<p>"Naw, we can't do it. He'll remember me mistake in change
an' de blasted trainboy biz."</p>

<p>"'I'll bet you a fiver he don't! You're trigged out altogether
new, an' your gran'mother wouldn't know ye."</p>

<p>"Nothin' like tryin', so here goes," and the speaker walked on
a few steps and half concealed himself behind a column, close
enough to hear all that was said.</p>

<p>"Well, how do you do, Deacon Jones? I am awfully surprised.
It's like two needles meeting in a haystack for us to
meet here. Isn't it now! It's a long time since I saw you back
in old Barnville, Sage county, Indiana; but I remembered you
the minute I clapped my eyes on you. I suspect you'd like to
hear from some of your old neighbors."</p>

<p>The speaker was still holding Uncle's hand, and Uncle was
looking at him in a bewildered manner, as if searching intensely
in the picture gallery of memory's old time faces.</p>

<p>"I see you can't place me, but I guess it's 'cause I was only
a chunk of a lad, but I see you often in the 'amen corner' of
the Barnville Baptist church. You see my father was killed in
one of the battles before Atlanta, and mother and me, when I was
a boy, didn't have much to live on, only our pension. So I had
to work hard, and didn't git around much for to be seen by anybody.

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page214" id="page214">[Pg 214]</a></span>

I was converted and joined the church just about the time
you moved away. Then I went into Mr. Monroe's store and got
to be chief clerk, and then when the bank was opened at Barnville
I was made cashier, and in three or four years I was called
to be cashier in the First National here, so you see I have been
more successful than most of the poor boys about Barnville whose
fathers never came back from defending their country."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/image61.jpg" width="360" height="306" alt="image61" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"I SEE YOU CAN'T PLACE ME."</span>
</div>

<p>"Ah, my boy," said Uncle, "my heart always warms up for
my comrades' children. I believe I recollect you now. Wasn't
you the boy what swum out into the crick at high water, when the
bridge went down while preacher Barker's wife was crossing with
her baby to bring him back from Bethel, and towed 'em safe to
shore?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page215" id="page215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I'm the lad."</p>

<p>"Widow Brown's son George?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, George Brown, from Barnville, is what I am."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my boy, I knowed I recollected you. My memory's
bad enough, but I haint forgot ye and yer brave deed. Well,
I'm glad your succeeding so well, and I hope you haint forgot
your redemption before the Cross."</p>

<p>"No, Deacon, I haven't, and I trust I am doing the Lord's
will, as I ought, though I know sometimes I fall short. I take
part more than most of the young people in our church, but I
trust I will still be moved to do more and more for our holy
cause."</p>

<p>"There, there! It's proud I am to see in this great wicked city
one of Barnville's boys so true to the teachings of our Lord and
Master that he learnt in our old home church."</p>

<p>Here the young man coughed lightly, as if the emotion of
religious memories was swelling up in his throat and almost
choking his utterance.</p>

<p>"But I guess everybody has forgot me at Barnville. It's mor'n
twelve years now."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Deacon. Every time I go back there to the old
church I hear somebody speak of Deacon Jones."</p>

<p>"Do tell&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>At this moment a young man came up hurriedly and tapped
"George" on the shoulder. "George" turned at once, and said:
"How do you do, Henry? Henry, this is my old friend, Deacon
Jones, from the home of my boyhood. Mr. Jones, Mr. Wilson.
I am proud, Deacon, to have you meet my friend here, who is
one of the Exposition directors and manager of one of the most
important departments on the grounds."</p>

<p>"I would be very glad to talk longer with you and your friend
Mr. Brown, but I was just hunting for Johnson, the paymaster. Iv'e

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page216" id="page216">[Pg 216]</a></span>

got to have two hundred dollars inside of ten minutes or there will
be the biggest howl among employees you ever saw."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't hunt any longer for Johnson, Mr. Wilson,
here's my check for the sum and you can cash it at once at the
World's Fair bank," and Mr. Brown, who was none other than
Arthur Blair, the confidence man and bogus detective, drew out
a First National bank check book.</p>

<p>"But that's exactly the trouble. It is now past banking hours,
and for some reason Johnson has not come around."</p>

<p>A troubled look came over Mr. Blair's face in his anxiety to
help out his friend. Turning to Uncle he said: "Perhaps the
Deacon can help my friend out and then cash my check here on
the grounds in the morning."</p>

<p>Uncle looked uneasy for a moment, and then said: "Of
course I can accommodate you," and he pulled out a roll of bills
and laid aside $200, which left him with only thirty dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. Blair had the check made out and was just extending it to
Uncle when Johnny came up, a curious spectator of the scene
before him. A second glance at the gentleman talking to his
grandfather and he began to jump up and down and whirl around
yelling at the top of his voice: "Perlice! fire! murder! robbers!
pickpockets! confidence men! thieves! thugs! highwaymen!
bandits! outlaws! catch 'em! hang 'em! crucify 'em!
here, here, everybody! surround 'em! close in on 'em! let no
guilty man escape!"</p>

<p>The two confidence men were for once too astonished to act
quickly, but one recovered himself soon enough to make a snatch
for the roll of bills in Uncle's hand. Two or three corners of
bills were torn away, but Uncle held the money. In an instant a
dozen men were crowding around, and among them two or three
officers.</p>

<p>"Catch that old thief!" yelled Blair, "he's got my money."

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page217" id="page217">[Pg 217]</a></span>

"Catch him!" cried Wilson, <ins class="correction" title="original: &quot;appearing">appearing</ins> to try to get at him,
"he's got our money."</p>

<p>Uncle was standing in blank stupefaction holding the bills in his
hands and staring at the gathering crowd.</p>

<p>An officer caught him by the arm and said: "Old man, where
did you get that money?"</p>

<p>Uncle found his tongue at last, and said: "Mister, I got that
from Bill Shaw for some of the finest Jerseys you ever seed."</p>

<p>"Here, officer, are our cards and the charge. We'll appear
in the morning at the station."</p>

<p>Johnny had been overwhelmed by the crowd, but by this time
he had edged his way in, and when he saw his grandfather in the
tolls of the law he yelled shrill enough to startle the whole crowd.</p>

<p>"Grandfather's done nothing, let him alone. Here's the thieving
hypocrits." But the two young men had disappeared among
the people, and Uncle was being taken away in such a crowd
that John could get no view whatever of the situation, so he ran
howling and sputtering round and round the fast increasing crowd
like a child gone insane. Presently the uselessness of his action
made him think of Mother and Fanny. At once he darted off to
the spot where he had seen them last, and in his wildness to find
them ran past them two or three times, till Fanny saw him and in
amazement cried, "Johnny! John! What on earth is the matter
with you, Johnny?"</p>

<p>Johnny darted over to them and yelled out: "He's tuk up!
The cops has got him! grandfather's tuck up, and he's done
nothing, and them bloody bandits got away again. Oh! Oh!
Oh!" and Johnny danced around, incapable of telling Fanny or
his grandma anything further.</p>

<p>But they learned enough to know that for some reason Uncle
had been arrested and was no doubt now in the guard house.
Aunt was overwhelmed with consternation, but Fanny ran over to

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page218" id="page218">[Pg 218]</a></span>

a guard standing near by and inquired: "If anyone is arrested on
the grounds where do they take them?"</p>

<p>"Over there to the guard house, Miss. There they go with
some old chap now."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/image62.jpg" width="365" height="332" alt="image62" title="Illustration" />
<span class="caption">"HE'S TUCK UP, HE'S TUCK UP! THE COPS GOT HIM!"</span>
</div>

<p>Fanny looked and could scarcely repress a scream as she saw
Uncle seated in the patrol wagon between two policemen. She
ran back to Aunt and Johnny and told him to run as fast as he
could to see where the wagon went, and they would follow in the
same direction. Johnny was off like a shot as he saw the wagon
rapidly disappearing over the way.</p>

<p>Out of breath they were coming up to the station door when
they met Johnny, hat off, and almost speechless with excitement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page219" id="page219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>"They've took Grandpa's money and everything, and locked
him up. They asked him if he had any friends, and he said he
had no friends here but us. Nobody listens to me, come quick,"
and he started them off on a run for the station. Arriving there,
the officers in charge told them he could do nothing for them unless
they could find some responsible persons to secure his appearance
for the preliminary hearing of the next day. They
were taken around where Uncle was, and a more woe-begone
appearing farmer never was seen.</p>

<p>"Ah, children, this is Chicago!"</p>

<p>"Grandpa, I'm going to find Mr. Warner. I believe he is a
good man, and will help us, as he told you he would. Johnny
and I will start at once to find him. I don't know what else to do."</p>

<p>"But, child," said Aunt, "it's already five o'clock, and the
people will all be gone home from the store."</p>

<p>"No difference, Grandma; you stay right here, for we're going."</p>

<p>She took the card from Uncle that Mr. Warner had given
him and left the building with Johnny walking resolutely by her
side.</p>

<h2><i>CHAPTER XIX</i></h2>

<h4>THE LOST FOUND</h4>

<p>They took a car, and in half an hour were at the doors of the
Clarendon Company. It was past business hours and the doors
were locked. Fanny was greatly distressed as to what she should
do; but there was no time to lose. Some young men were
standing near eyeing her with the usual sensual greediness of
their kind. Her mission was too urgent for her to notice their
insinuating remarks.</p>

<p>"Can any of you tell me where or how I may find the gentleman
named on this card?"</p>

<p>Her demeanor, so unaffected and true, brought all their latent
manhood out, and each one was anxious for the honor of helping
her.</p>

<p>Some one standing in the rear made an unbecoming remark,
and instantly the eyes of those about her turned on him so
meaningly that he slunk away. One of them took her into a
restaurant near by and made known to the proprietor what she
wanted. He said Mr. Warner lived with the head of the firm, a
Mr. Sterling. The street and number of the residence was
given to a cabman, and soon they were driving rapidly away.</p>

<p>Mr. Sterling was sitting alone in his library reading the evening
papers, when he heard a determined ring at the door. His
door was open into the hall, and he went himself at once to
answer the call.</p>

<p>It was growing quite dark, and he could distinguish only that

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page221" id="page221">[Pg 221]</a></span>

there were two young people standing before him.</p>

<p>"Is this where Mr. Sterling lives?" said one, in a very pleasing
tone of voice.</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 378px;">

<span class="caption">"HE HEARD A DETERMINED RING AT THE DOOR."</span>
</div>

<p>"We are very sorry to disturb you, but we are in some trouble,
and a gentleman by the name of Warner told us if, for any reason,
we needed any assistance while in the city, to call on him.
We went to the store, but it was closed, and then we were
directed to come to you in the hope that through you we could
find Mr. Warner."</p>

<p>John and Fanny saw a kindly appearing business man before
them, and they spoke with the utmost confidence in his good-will.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page222" id="page222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>"So, so! that is good. I have heard him speak several times
recently of a young lady he met on the train, and somewhere else
once or twice since. Are you the young lady I have been teasing
him about? Now, that is good. Of course you can see him.
He lives with me and is up-stairs now. May I ask what is the
nature of your trouble?"</p>

<p>Johnny could hold his tongue no longer.</p>

<p>"Why, sir, they've tuck Grandpa up and got him in jail 'cause
I stopped some crooks a gettin' his money."</p>

<p>"I don't see, my boy, just how that could be," and the gentleman
seemed somewhat suspicious of their grandfather.</p>

<p>"I don't, nuther," blurted Johnny.</p>

<p>"Come in. I will send for Mr. Warner and see what he can
do for you."</p>

<p>They followed him into the room, and he motioned them to
take seats. Then he went out and sent some one up-stairs for
Mr. Warner.</p>

</div>

<p>The room was richly furnished, but had an air of negligence
about it that betokened the want of an interested woman's taste
and care. They could hear voices now and then coming from
some distant part of the house, but they sounded more like the
hilarious gaiety of servants than of persons having such a cultured
place for a home. From the tapestries on the walls to the
piano and the great case full of books, everything was arranged
for the convenience of the one rather than for the taste of the
many. It was the most pleasing home, where money was
lavishly spent, that she had ever been in, and perhaps she is not
to be blamed that for a moment she was carried away by her
surroundings, and the longing came over her to be so happily
situated as this. Seeing a life-size painting of a woman placed
on a high frame near a desk, she went over to look at it. There
was something so lifelike and natural, and even familiar, about

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page225" id="page225">[Pg 225]</a></span>

the picture that she still further forgot how she came to be
there. She did not hear Mr. Sterling as he re-entered the room,
but he came up to her, and as she stepped aside the light fell
full upon her face almost on a level with the picture in the
frame. A startled expression came over the face of Mr. Sterling,
which deepened into an amazement. His face grew white,
and he looked at her and then at the picture, and then from the
picture to her.</p>

<p>The light of some quick intuition spread over her face, and
she thrust her hand into her cape pocket and drew out a small
gold locket, which she opened and looked at intently, and then
from the face of the man to the face of the woman. Mr. Sterling
saw the locket.</p>

<p>"What are you looking at, child?" he almost shrieked.</p>

<p>"My mother and father," she said.</p>

<p>He caught the locket out of her hand.</p>

<p>"There, there," he cried, pointing to the painting; "there is
the same picture, it is the picture of the only one I ever loved,
the one now in heaven, and you are her living image. In
God's name, tell me, child, what is your name."</p>

<p>"My name is Fanny," she said, "Fanny Jones; sometimes
they call me 'Fanny Sterling.' Mary Sterling was my&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She never finished the sentence. With a cry of joy he caught
her in his arms, sobbing and laughing; "My child, my child, my
own little girl; found, found at last!"</p>

<p>Johnny at this amazing outburst had come up as if to protect
his sister, and as Mr. Sterling saw him he cried, "And is this your
brother, the baby I left never to see again till now?"</p>

<p>Mr. Sterling sat down and drew Johnny up to him. "A rough,
hearty, honest farmer boy," he said; "I can not realize that after
an endless search, you have been sent to me in such a strange
manner."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page226" id="page226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Sterling overcome with his emotion, buried his face in his
hands, and Fanny kneeling by his side, looked <ins class="correction" title="original: wisfully">wistfully</ins> at him, not
knowing what to think or do. Mr. Warner, in answer to the call,
had come to the door and witnessed the whole scene. He could
not understand it, and his astonishment rendered him speechless.
At last without moving from his place at the door, he said:
"What can this mean, may I ask? It is a mystery to me."</p>

<p>"My children," was all Mr. Sterling could say.</p>

<p>Her mission there suddenly came back to Fanny. She sprang
to her feet and cried: "Oh! Mr. Warner, my grandpa is in
trouble. You told us to call on you if we needed assistance in
anything. He is in the police station as a result of our acquaintance
with that man on the train. I came for you to go with us
and see what you could do to help us out."</p>

<p>Everything was soon explained to them all; the cab that
brought John and Fanny there was dismissed, and Mr. Sterling's
carriage was soon speeding them all to the fastest train for the
Fair grounds. At the police station half an hour later there was
sorrow turned to joy, and a meeting that was too happy to be told.
Uncle was released on bail to appear the next afternoon to answer
to the charges, and there was a reunion at the hotel in another
hour, when every past ill was forever buried in the pleasure of the
present and the promise of the future. The next morning Mr.
Sterling's house was made their abiding place, and Fanny became
queen of his home.</p>

<p>That afternoon Uncle was in the police court awaiting his
accusers. The judge called the case, but the witnesses were not
there. Their names were called, but no one answered. Just
then two boys came rushing into the room.</p>

<p>"Hold up, yer honnur," said one, "de persecution will soon
arrive. I've been after 'em, an' I got 'em. I see 'em doin' de

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page227" id="page227">[Pg 227]</a></span>

robbin', and' I found a policeman whut had sense enuf to take
'em in. See!"</p>

<span class="caption">"LOUIS CAME IN DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT BEFORE THE BURLY POLICEMAN WITH HIS TWO WARDS."</span>
</div>

<p>The irrepressible Louis had hardly ceased speaking when a
burly policeman entered with the two confidence men who had
attempted so perseveringly to get Uncle's money. Behind them
came the man they had just been trying to rob. Johnny and
Louis had seen them talking to a countryman, and, divining what
was intended, followed them as they tolled him away to a place
where they could accomplish the robbery. They found a policeman
on the way, who took in the situation and assisted the boys
to catch the fellows in the act.</p>

<p>Uncle's case was dismissed, and Louis succeeded in seeing
the crooks given a chance to learn an honest trade at Joliet.</p>

<p>Sight-seeing as a business now gave over to a new order of
things. The change was almost beyond what a dream could be.
Before the C. C. of C. C. returned home there was a social
gathering at Fanny's new <ins class="correction" title="original: full stop missing">home.</ins> Johnny had one young friend
present and Fanny had five. Mr. Warner had often noticed that
Louis was a very reliable boy, and Mr. Sterling gave him a good
position in his store. Uncle and Aunt could not part with their
children, and Johnny was so thoroughly a farmer that there could
be no thought of him doing anything else; therefore, it was
decided that Uncle's Jerseys should be removed to Mr. Sterling's
farm, half an hour's ride from the city, and that Johnny
should have charge of them there. Soon after, Uncle and Aunt
sold their farm and henceforth lived as they pleased with Johnny
and the Jerseys, or with Fanny in her happy city home. Mr.
Warner is trying to win the approval of Fanny to some of his
plans of happy life, and John and Louis believe they are more
than kindly remembered by two of those bright girls known as
the C. C. of C. C.</p>

<p>Here we may leave Uncle Jeremiah and family to the good of
domestic contentment and to the well-earned peace of having
lived life well. If the Exposition has awakened the sentiments
of patriotism and reverence in the minds of all its visitors, and
has broadened their views concerning mankind, and made more
charitable their hearts toward the rest of the world, as it has done
with this one true rural family, then it has been a mighty success,
though millions of dollars were lost in its construction.</p>

<p>This need be none the less true to all, though no two people
have seen the same World's Columbian Exposition. In all the

<span class='pagenum'><a name="page229" id="page229">[Pg 229]</a></span>

vast throngs that have walked its streets and crowded its palaces
for half a year there can be no two individuals who have the same
story to tell, or who have the same thought to pay out to the
world from that mint of human <ins class="correction" title="original: full stop missing">intelligence.</ins></p>

<p>There is so much within the great "White City" that single
pieces are lost like flowers in a landscape or like ferns on a
mountain side. But its beauties inspire every soul; its refinements
chasten every heart; its achievements exalt every mind,
and its lessons give strength to every <ins class="correction" title="original: full stop missing">life.</ins></p>
